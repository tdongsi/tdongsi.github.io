    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Code snippet</h3>

<p>There is a simple idiom to ensure your bash scripts to always do proper cleanup operations before exiting, even when something goes wrong during execution.
In the context of Java or Python, this is similar to a <code>finally</code> clause that will execute after any exception is caught during execution.</p>

<pre><code class="bash DO THIS"># Setup trap to cleanup before exiting script
function cleanup {
    echo "Removing temp files..."
    if [[ -f $CMD_TMPFILE ]] ; then
        rm $CMD_TMPFILE
    fi
    if [[ -f $LOG_TMPFILE ]] ; then
        rm $LOG_TMPFILE
    fi
}
trap cleanup EXIT

# Setup

# Thousand lines of code here
</code></pre>

<p>Putting the cleanup operations at the end of the bash script might not work in cases of error.
Since the bash script already stops executing due to some fatal error, those clean up commands might never run.</p>

<pre><code class="bash DON'T DO THIS">
# Setup

# Thousand lines of code here

# This might not run when there is error
echo "Removing temp files..."
if [[ -f $CMD_TMPFILE ]] ; then
    rm $CMD_TMPFILE
fi
if [[ -f $LOG_TMPFILE ]] ; then
    rm $LOG_TMPFILE
fi
</code></pre>

<p>For example, in Vertica, you should always run <a href="https://my.vertica.com/docs/7.1.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/SQLReferenceManual/Functions/VerticaFunctions/START_REFRESH.htm"><code>SELECT START_REFRESH()</code></a>
at the end of a deployment script, regardless of any error encountered during script execution.
It is a good candidate for using <code>trap</code> statement.
Adding those commands at the end of the script will not work in cases there is an error during deployment, and you might end up with &ldquo;AHM Does Not Advance&rdquo;-related errors (see this <a href="/blog/2016/02/29/vertica-9-refresh-projections/">post</a>).</p>

<h3>Trap multiple signals</h3>

<p>Note that many online examples for <code>trap</code> use a list of signals for cleanup tasks like this <code>trap cleanup INT TERM EXIT</code>, i.e., trapping not only EXIT signal but also INT and TERM signals.
I believe once <code>EXIT</code> signal is used, other signals such as <code>INT</code> or <code>TERM</code> are redundant for cleanup purposes.
<code>EXIT</code> or 0 signal is invoked when the shell exits, an event that also happens when an <code>INT</code> or <code>TERM</code> signal is received.
It is easy to confirm that with the following short bash script:</p>

<pre><code class="plain Trap tests in Mac OSX">MTVL1288aeea2-82:code tdongsi$ cat test_trap.sh
#!/bin/bash
trap 'echo SIGNAL CAPTURED' EXIT
sleep 3

MTVL1288aeea2-82:code tdongsi$ ./test_trap.sh &amp; sleep 1; kill -INT %1
[1] 6613
SIGNAL CAPTURED
[1]+  Interrupt: 2            ./test_trap.sh

MTVL1288aeea2-82:code tdongsi$ ./test_trap.sh &amp; sleep 1; kill -TERM %1
[1] 6624
SIGNAL CAPTURED
[1]+  Terminated: 15          ./test_trap.sh
</code></pre>

<p>As shown above, a lone <code>EXIT</code> is enough to capture <code>INT</code> and <code>TERM</code> signals.
Having said that, I understand that my tests can only verify bash on Mac OSX.
There are probably different shell variants on different operating systems which do not always work that way.</p>

<p>The problem of those <code>trap</code> examples lies in when someone copies and uses the code directly from the web, without understanding how it works.
Listing multiple signals can make the <code>cleanup</code> steps executed twice, once for the signal such as <code>TERM</code> and once for <code>EXIT</code>, as shown in the modified experiment below.
Not all cleanup steps could be and should be executed twice.
For example, it is almost always true that removing some temporary file/folder should not be executed twice during a cleanup.</p>

<pre><code class="plain Problem of trapping multiple signals">MTVL1288aeea2-82:code tdongsi$ cat test_trap.sh
#!/bin/bash
trap 'echo SIGNAL CAPTURED' INT TERM EXIT
sleep 3

MTVL1288aeea2-82:code tdongsi$ ./test_trap.sh &amp; sleep 1; kill -INT %1
[1] 7258
SIGNAL CAPTURED
SIGNAL CAPTURED
[1]+  Exit 130                ./test_trap.sh

MTVL1288aeea2-82:code tdongsi$ ./test_trap.sh &amp; sleep 1; kill -TERM %1
[1] 7278
Terminated: 15
SIGNAL CAPTURED
SIGNAL CAPTURED
[1]+  Exit 143                ./test_trap.sh
</code></pre>

<p>In short, you should know how <code>trap</code> works on your production system before listing multiple signals as its parameters, especially when coupled with <code>EXIT</code> signal.</p>

<h3>Other usage notes</h3>

<p>The signal names might be specified with or without prefix <code>SIG</code> or even with numeric values for signal numbers, e.g., 2 for INT (see list below).</p>

<pre><code class="plain List of signals">MTVL1288aeea2-82:octopress tdongsi$ kill -l
 1) SIGHUP   2) SIGINT   3) SIGQUIT  4) SIGILL
 5) SIGTRAP  6) SIGABRT  7) SIGEMT   8) SIGFPE
 9) SIGKILL 10) SIGBUS  11) SIGSEGV 12) SIGSYS
13) SIGPIPE 14) SIGALRM 15) SIGTERM 16) SIGURG
17) SIGSTOP 18) SIGTSTP 19) SIGCONT 20) SIGCHLD
21) SIGTTIN 22) SIGTTOU 23) SIGIO   24) SIGXCPU
25) SIGXFSZ 26) SIGVTALRM   27) SIGPROF 28) SIGWINCH
29) SIGINFO 30) SIGUSR1 31) SIGUSR2

OR 

MTVL1288aeea2-82:octopress tdongsi$ man signal
</code></pre>

<p>If one of the signals specified in <code>trap</code> statement is <code>DEBUG</code>, the list of COMMANDS specified in <code>trap</code> statement will be executed after every simple command.
This is useful for debugging purpose.
The following example is taken from <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/chap_12.html">here</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="bash Tracing when a variable is used">declare -t VARIABLE=value
trap "echo VARIABLE is being used here." DEBUG

# rest of the script
</code></pre>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A more general title would be &ldquo;Use a single mocking framework ONLY&rdquo;.
Personally, it just means that I should defer learning Wiremock&rsquo;s advanced features and learn JMockit (specifically JMockit 1.2x) which is recently adopted at work.</p>

<p>We know that mocking is a critical enabler for unit tests and automated functional tests that don’t require networks and databases and can complete in reasonable time.
Mocking tools work by integrating with and replacing critical parts of the Java Class Loader.
It means that having multiple mocking tools in use will lead to those tools contend to replace the class loader in JVM.
This will lead to complex and unexpected consequences and, as a result, random test failures and unreliable tests.
For example, we might have tests that work fine locally but start failing when running in combination with others (using other mocking tools) because different mocking frameworks take over the class loader in different order or in different ways.</p>

<p>To fix that, we need to standardize and settle on a single mocking framework for an organization or a project.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Calendar types</h3>

<p>There are surprisingly many types of calendar. Some of them are:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Regular Calendar</strong>: regular solar calendar date range as we know.

<ul>
<li>Example: January 01, 2006 to December 31, 2006.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_calendar"><strong>Lunar Calendar</strong></a>: based on cycles of the lunar phases.

<ul>
<li>Example: January 29, 2006 to February 17, 2007.</li>
<li>A lunar year is defined as 12 lunations, which is about 354 days.</li>
<li>In every two or three years, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunisolar_calendar">thirteenth-month</a> (intercalary month or leap month) is added to bring the calendar year into synchronisation with the solar year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Calendar</strong>: a company’s selected calendar date range for required SEC financial statement filing.

<ul>
<li>Example: August 01, 2005 to July 31, 2006 is my company&rsquo;s fiscal year 2006.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tax Calendar</strong>: A number sequence representing weeks in a Tax year which begins right after the US Tax Day.

<ul>
<li>Example: April 16, 2005 to April 15, 2006.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Retail Calendar</strong>: also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%E2%80%934%E2%80%935_calendar">4-4-5 Calendar</a> or 544 calendar. 544 describes the number of weeks for a given quarter. Each quarter begins with a 5 week &ldquo;month&rdquo;, followed by 2 four week &ldquo;months&rdquo;.

<ul>
<li>Example: July 31, 2005 to July 29, 2006.</li>
<li>Why? This calendar ensures all 4 quarters in a calendar year are equal. This allows comparing weekly data (e.g., retail sales) to the prior year without correcting for times when regular calendar weeks break across months or quarters.</li>
<li>How? It usually uses the same end month as the fiscal calendar and each retail week consists of Sunday through Saturday.

<ul>
<li>The retail year end is defined as &ldquo;the last Saturday of the month at the fiscal year end&rdquo;.</li>
<li>If August 1st is Sunday, it is retail calendar&rsquo;s starting date. The Saturday July 31st is the last Saturday and end of the last retail year.</li>
<li>If August 1st is Monday, then Saturday July 30th is end of the last retail year, and July 31st is the start of the current retail year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ISO calendar</strong>: provided in Python <code>datetime</code> module.

<ul>
<li>Example: January 02, 2006 to December 31, 2006.</li>
<li>The first week of an ISO year is the first (Gregorian/regular) calendar week of a year containing a Thursday.</li>
<li>Each week starts at Monday and ends at Sunday.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<p>Out of the above calendar types, retail calendar seems to have more complex rules. However, this calendar type is frequently used in industries like retail and manufacturing for ease of planning around it.</p>

<h3>Mocking current time in Python</h3>

<p>Due to retail calendar&rsquo;s desirable characteristics, we may have code that work with retail calendars in commercial applications eventually.
I ended up working with a utility Python module for retail calendar with functions which return values based on current time/date.
For example, a utility function to check if a given date is in the current 544 year works like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python Original version">def is_current_year_544(given_date):
    my_today = datetime.date.today()
    if year_start_544(my_today) &lt;= given_date &lt;= year_end_544(my_today):
        return "Y"
    else:
        return "N"
</code></pre>

<p>Some utility functions in that module are even more complicated than this example function.
For those, I think calling <code>today</code> or <code>now</code> inside those functions is a bad design.
They are essentially another <em>variable</em> in those functions (i.e., when do you run?), and it is better to expose that variable as an input parameter.
In addition, being able to specify what &ldquo;today&rdquo; or &ldquo;now&rdquo; value is will make automated unit testing easier.
For example, I want to know how my Python programs work if it runs on a particular date, such as end of retail year July 29, 2006.
A probably better, more testable function would be something like this.</p>

<pre><code class="python More desirable">def is_current_year_544(given_date, run_date = datetime.date.today()):
    if year_start_544(run_date) &lt;= given_date &lt;= year_end_544(run_date):
        return "Y"
    else:
        return "N"
</code></pre>

<p>However, in reality, you sometimes have to live with the original utility Python module.
Then, the workaround for unit testing is to &ldquo;mock&rdquo; current date and time, i.e., overriding those returned by <code>today</code> and <code>now</code> methods with some specific values.
In Python, it can be done by using some mocking framework, such as illustrated <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/examples.html#partial-mocking">here</a>.
Fortunately, my life was made even easier with <a href="https://github.com/spulec/freezegun"><code>freezegun</code> library</a>.
To install <code>freezegun</code> on Mac OSX, simply run</p>

<pre><code class="plain   ">pip install freezegun
</code></pre>

<p>Using this <code>freezegun</code> library, I can easily specify my &ldquo;current date&rdquo; as &ldquo;July 29, 2006&rdquo; by adding the following decorator with some string &ldquo;2006-07-29&rdquo; for that date.</p>

<pre><code class="python Unit test with mocking">    @freeze_time("2006-07-29")
    def test_year544_end(self):
        """
        Mock today() at 2006-07-29
        """
        self._verify_544_methods()
</code></pre>

<p>For full usage of <code>freezegun</code>, refer to its <a href="https://github.com/spulec/freezegun">quickstart guide</a>.
It should be noted that <code>freezegun</code> can mock <code>datetime</code> calls from other modules and it works great for testing with <code>datetime</code> calls.
However, you might encounter some occasional failures in your unit tests when working with <code>time</code> module.
From my personal experience, in those cases, note that time zones must be accounted for when mocking with <code>time</code> module by specifying <code>tz_offset</code> in the decorator <code>freeze_time</code>.</p>

    <link href="http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2015/11/18/unicode-in-perl/"/>
    <updated>2015-11-18T15:40:20-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2015/11/18/unicode-in-perl</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For automation in Perl, Unicode can be tricky, especially when you want your automated jobs/tests to work across platforms (Windows and *nix). If you have a choice, another scripting language like Python may be better off in dealing with Unicode texts. If you don&rsquo;t have a choice and must use Perl (specifically Perl 5) like I used to, some of these tips may help get you started.</p>

<p>The most common code snippet that I used in my Perl codes when dealing with Unicode texts is this Unicode preamble:</p>

<pre><code class="perl Unicode preamble">#!/usr/bin/env perl
use strict;

##############################################################
#### Unicode preamble
use utf8;      # so literals and identifiers in Perl scripts can be in UTF-8
use warnings;  # on by default
use warnings  qw(FATAL utf8);    # fatalize encoding glitches
use open      qw(:std :utf8);    # undeclared streams in UTF-8
use charnames qw(:full :short);  # unneeded in v5.16

##############################################################

my $name = '你好世界';
my $checkPrint = "Print Unicode variable: $name \n";
print $checkPrint;
</code></pre>

<p>The first two lines are standard and should be included in any Perl script. The rest are specifically for dealing with UTF-8 (the most commonly used encoding of Unicode). Another useful code snippet is for printing Unicode codepoints (Quiz: what is the difference between a codepoint and its encoding?):</p>

<pre><code class="perl Print Unicode codepoints">my $unicode_helloworld = "\x{4F60}\x{597D}\x{4E16}\x{754C}";
print "Unicode codepoints: $unicode_helloworld\n";
</code></pre>

<p>More recipes for working with Unicode in Perl 5 can be found in References below.</p>

<p>One dilemma you might be facing when your Perl codes run in Windows is to choose which encoding for your script files: ANSI or UTF-8. In my own experience:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the script file encoding is ANSI, I usually have better luck in &ldquo;What you see is what you get&rdquo; department: for example, files created in filesystem have the filenames with same Unicode characters, such as Japanese/Chinese characters, in Perl scripts. The downside of ANSI encoding is when I try to do regex matching of those Japanese/Chinese characters, I get &ldquo;malformed regex&rdquo; error.</li>
<li>If the script file encoding is UTF-8, the files created in filesystem usually have different Japanese/Chinese characters from those in Perl scripts. However, Japanese/Chinese characters in other places such as log files are matching with ones in Perl scripts. There is no &ldquo;malformed regex&rdquo; error when doing regex matching. However, that correctly formed regex matching may be useless if you need to do matching for output from filesystem such as &ldquo;ls&rdquo; command&rsquo;s output.</li>
</ul>


<!---
Overall, I used ANSI encoding for my Perl scripts as my automation project at that time has to run on Windows/Linux/Mac and interacts regularly with filesystem.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this <a href="https://github.com/tdongsi/python/tree/master/PerformanceLog">mini-project</a>, I created a Python script (PerformanceLog.py) to record JMX values from a running Cassandra instance, using JMXTerm (<a href="http://wiki.cyclopsgroup.org/jmxterm/">http://wiki.cyclopsgroup.org/jmxterm/</a>), and do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Put the records into a Cassandra table.</li>
<li>Plot the results.</li>
</ul>


<p>The project is based on a Cassandra interview question found on Glassdoor.</p>

<p>Currently, the first version only works with Windows version of Cassandra (using DataStax Community installer). Developed and tested in Python 2.7.</p>

<h2>Input/Output</h2>

<p><strong>Input</strong></p>

<p>When running the script from command line, the following arguments must be provided:</p>

<ul>
<li>installDir INSTALLDIR:  Path to installation directory.</li>
<li>host HOST: URL string for Cassandra instance. Only localhost tested.</li>
<li>jmxTerm JMXTERM: Path to jmxterm jar file.</li>
<li>osString OSSTRING: String that represents the current OS. Windows: win. Mac: mac. Unix/Linux: linux.</li>
</ul>


<p>Example:</p>

<blockquote><p>python PerformanceLog.py -installDir C:\datastax -host localhost -jmxTerm lib\jmxterm.jar -osString win</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Output</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>CSV file with each field for each JMX metric.</li>
</ul>


<p>Example:</p>

<blockquote><p>  SSTableCount,DataSize,c95thPercentile</p>
