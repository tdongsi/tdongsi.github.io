    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have all seen it before: intermittent unit test failures.
It could be agonizing that unit tests pass locally, but then fail in the Jenkins unit test build.</p>

<p>In our experience, one of the most common causes is:
<strong>static initialization code that dynamically sets a static member variable from a config file value.</strong></p>

<p>What happens locally?
If you’re running from the command line, you probably have some environment variables set.
These allow some ConfigHelper class to find the resource properties files and load them.
In the end, code that looks like the following often ends up succeeding:</p>

<pre><code class="java DbQueue class">private static final String MY_CONFIG = ConfigHelper.getBoolean("config_key", false);
</code></pre>

<p>But the unit tests on the CI server run without being set up for a Tomcat application server run.
Instead, they run using some mock framework such as JMockit.
Mocking in this scenario is a good, desirable thing.
However, it also means that code like that ends up failing to find those resources.
In the example above, the class <code>DbQueue</code>&rsquo;s static code was invoked <strong>even though the class itself has been mocked out</strong>.
And very often, classes like that throw some misleading exceptions, especially when trying to load and convert to a numeric value from a resource.</p>

<p>So, how do we fix it?
How do we prevent that class static member initialization code from being invoked in Jenkins test build?
The answer is when we mock the class in JMockit using the <code>@Mocked</code> annotation, we can provide the <code>stubOutClassInitialization=true</code> parameter, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="java Mock with JMockit">public class MyTest {
    @Mocked( stubOutClassInitialization = true )
    DbQueue queue;

    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>That will prevent the static code in the class <code>DbQueue</code> from running in Jenkins unit test builds.
The additional benefit of doing this <em>correctly</em> and <em>completely</em> is that we’ll be able to run our unit tests from inside Eclipse WITHOUT setting the <code>–DSBNHOME=</code> environment variable and the test will still complete as desired.</p>

    <link href="http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2016/06/06/java-unit-test-performance/"/>
    <updated>2016-06-06T22:47:42-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2016/06/06/java-unit-test-performance</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEhu57pih5w">this</a>, the right way of automated testing is that we have lots of unit tests as majority of our overall automated tests, supplemented by a smaller set of functional tests and even fewer sets of integration tests (a.k.a., Test Automation Pyramid).
However, for that strategy to work, we should pay attention to unit test performance.
It is not productive for us developers to wait 30+ minutes to run unit tests locally, especially when we have multiple check-ins per day.
In addition, the runtime will get compounded as we add more unit tests.
Here, I list out few commonly observed mistakes to avoid and suggestions that frequently improve Java unit test performance.</p>

<p>1) Do NOT add loggings/printing to your tests.
Use TestNG assertions instead of checking screen output.
Remove from the test classes all the <code>System.out.println</code> statements (that we might add when we start writing unit tests).
The logs don&rsquo;t matter when we&rsquo;re running in parallel.
Moreover, it could add 5-10 minutes to the build time, regardless of running in sequential or parallel.</p>

<p>2) Another common mistake is to override the default <code>System.out</code> by calling <code>System.setOut(PrintStream)</code> and verify by asserting against log statements.
This tactic is often used to verify expected method invocations, which will subsequently generate some specific log entries.
For such behavior testing, consider using <a href="https://jmockit.googlecode.com/svn-history/r2056/trunk/www/tutorial/BehaviorBasedTesting.html">Jmockit Verifications</a> instead of depending on output of logs generated.</p>

<p>3) Mock logging and config classes if applicable.
Otherwise, we might encountered errors like &ldquo;Exception encountered, logging will be disabled&rdquo;, probably thrown by JMockit.
If there is any static initialization block in the mocked class for logging and configuration purposes, consider using <code>(stubOutClassInitialization = true)</code> (see <a href="/blog/2016/06/30/java-intermittent-test-failures/">this</a>).</p>

<p>4) Choosing the right parallel execution settings can substantially improve the execution time.
However, for parallel test runs, consider splitting big test classes (> 100 tests) that are taking much longer than others.
As we are running test classes in parallel across multiple JVMs, it is often the case that all JVMs are shut down except for one or two which are running some big test classes.
Splitting those classes into multiple smaller classes will distribute the load equally across multiple JVMs.</p>

<p>5) Out of all the <code>maven-surefire</code> options for running tests in parallel, the one that worked considering JMockit limitations with parallel execution (and our test structure) are as below:</p>

<pre><code class="xml Maven-surefire options">&lt;parallel&gt;classes&lt;/parallel&gt;
&lt;forkCount&gt;${forkCount}&lt;/forkCount&gt;
&lt;reuseForks&gt;false&lt;/resuseForks&gt;

    <link href="http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2016/05/21/convert-python-objects-to-json/"/>
    <updated>2016-05-21T22:09:50-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2016/05/21/convert-python-objects-to-json</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>JSON serialization in Java</h3>

<p>In Java, it is pretty straight-forward to convert Java objects (POJO) to JSON using <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson">Jackson library</a>.
The following code will convert an example POJO to JSON:</p>

<pre><code class="java Example POJO">public class Config {
    public String type;
    public String host;
    public String user;
    public String password;
    public String url;
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="java Jackson examples">ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
Config conn = new Config();
conn.type = "hive";
conn.host = "192.168.5.184";
conn.user = "cloudera";
conn.password = "password";
conn.url = "jdbc:hive2://192.168.5.184:10000/DWH";

// POJO to JSON in file
mapper.writeValue(new File("config.json"), obj);
// POJO to JSON in String
String jsonInString = mapper.writerWithDefaultPrettyPrinter()
        .writeValueAsString(conn);
</code></pre>

<p>The JSON output is shown below.
Note that the keys (e.g., &ldquo;type&rdquo;, &ldquo;host&rdquo;) appear in the same order as defined in the <code>Config</code> class.
This will become important later when we try to convert Python objects to JSON.</p>

<pre><code class="json JSON representation of Config object">{
  "type" : "hive",
  "host" : "192.168.5.184",
  "user" : "cloudera",
  "password" : "password",
  "url" : "jdbc:hive2://192.168.5.184:10000/DWH"
}
</code></pre>

<h3>JSON serialization in Python</h3>

<p>In Python, we have <code>json</code> module to convert a <em>serializable</em> object to JSON format.
The first attempt at JSON serialization in Python may look like this, with a slightly complex Python object is intentionally used as an example:</p>

<pre><code class="python First attempt at JSON serialization">class Config(object):
    pass


def get_hive_config():
    """ Get pre-defined Hive configuration.

    :return: Config object for Hive.
    """

    conn = Config()
    conn.type = "hive"
    conn.host = "192.168.5.184"
    conn.user = "cloudera"
    conn.password = "password"
    conn.url = "jdbc:hive2://192.168.5.184:10000/DWH"

    return conn


def get_vertica_config():
    """ Get pre-defined Vertica configuration.

    :return: Config object for Vertica.
    """

    conn = Config()
    conn.type = "vertica"
    conn.host = "192.168.5.174"
    conn.user = "dbadmin"
    conn.password = "password"
    conn.url = "jdbc:vertica://192.168.5.174:5433/VMart"

    return conn


def create_config_file(filename, query_generator):

    hive_source = get_hive_config()
    vertica_target = get_vertica_config()

    config = Config()
    config.source = hive_source
    config.target = vertica_target
    config.testName = "count"
    config.queries = query_generator

    with open(filename, 'w') as config_file:
        json.dump(config, config_file)


def main():

    FILE_NAME = "hive_vertica_count.json"
    query_generator = generate_count_queries()
    create_config_file(FILE_NAME, query_generator)
</code></pre>

<p>This first attempt with <code>json.dump(config, config_file)</code> will fail with the following error:</p>

<pre><code class="python JSON serialization error">TypeError: &lt;__main__.Config object at 0x10ab824d0&gt; is not JSON serializable
</code></pre>

<p>As the message indicates, <code>Config</code> object is not JSON serializable.
<code>json.dump</code> function expects a serializable object such as one of Python standard object types (see Python to JSON mapping table below) or their subclasses.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Python </th>
<th> JSON </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> dict </td>
<td> object </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> list, tuple </td>
<td> array </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> str, unicode </td>
<td> string </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> int, long, float </td>
<td> number </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> True </td>
<td> true </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> False </td>
<td> false </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> None </td>
<td> null </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p><br></p>

<p>The solution for that problem is to specify the <code>default</code> parameter with a function that returns object&rsquo;s <code>__dict__</code> attribute.
<code>__dict__</code> is the internal attribute dictionary that contains all attributes associated with an object.
Object attribute references are translated to lookups in this dictionary, e.g., <code>o.x</code> is translated to <code>o.__dict__["x"]</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="python Correct options">    with open(filename, 'w') as config_file:
        json.dump(config, config_file, default=vars, indent=4)
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="python Pretty print without ordering">{
    "source": {
        "url": "jdbc:hive2://192.168.5.184:10000/DWH", 
        "host": "192.168.5.184", 
        "password": "password", 
        "type": "hive", 
        "user": "cloudera"
    }, 
    "queries": "...", 
    "target": {
        "url": "jdbc:vertica://192.168.5.174:5433/VMart", 
        "host": "192.168.5.174", 
        "password": "password", 
        "type": "vertica", 
        "user": "dbadmin"
    }, 
    "testName": "count"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here, we use <code>vars</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#vars">built-in function</a> to retrieve the object&rsquo;s <code>__dict__</code> attribute.
Note that simply using <code>json.dump(vars(config), config_file)</code> will NOT work if any attribute of the object is another complex object (e.g., <code>source</code> and <code>target</code> attributes in this example).
For more complex objects such as those include <code>set</code>s, we may have to define our own Encoder that extends <code>json.JSONEncoder</code> and provide it to <code>json.dump</code> function.
The next <a href="/blog/2016/05/25/convert-python-objects-to-json-ordered-keys/">post</a> will discuss how to print keys in order of which they are defined, like in the Java example.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A more general title would be &ldquo;Use a single mocking framework ONLY&rdquo;.
Personally, it just means that I should defer learning Wiremock&rsquo;s advanced features and learn JMockit (specifically JMockit 1.2x) which is recently adopted at work.</p>

<p>We know that mocking is a critical enabler for unit tests and automated functional tests that don’t require networks and databases and can complete in reasonable time.
Mocking tools work by integrating with and replacing critical parts of the Java Class Loader.
It means that having multiple mocking tools in use will lead to those tools contend to replace the class loader in JVM.
This will lead to complex and unexpected consequences and, as a result, random test failures and unreliable tests.
For example, we might have tests that work fine locally but start failing when running in combination with others (using other mocking tools) because different mocking frameworks take over the class loader in different order or in different ways.</p>

<p>To fix that, we need to standardize and settle on a single mocking framework for an organization or a project.</p>

    <link href="http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2016/01/18/aws-developing-with-amazon-s3/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-18T17:13:28-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2016/01/18/aws-developing-with-amazon-s3</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon Simple Storage Service or S3 is a simple, scalable web services to store and retrieve data.
This post talks about basic concepts of buckets and objects in S3, basic and advanced operations on objects in S3, and standard development considerations when working with S3 using SDK.</p>

<h3>S3 Buckets and Objects</h3>

<p>Files of any kind such as text, video, photo are stored as objects in S3 <em>buckets</em>.
The bucket name must be globally unique across Amazon S3. It is your responsibility to ensure uniqueness of the bucket name.
A bucket can be <em>versioning-enabled</em>, it will store every version of every object in the bucket.</p>

<p>Each <em>object</em> in S3 is identified by a unique key. The object key is used for upload and retrieval. Alphanumeric characters and <code>!-_.*'/</code> are allowed in a key name.</p>

<p>Bucket naming tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>To ensure uniqueness, you might prefix the bucket name with the name of your organization.</li>
<li>Avoid using a period in the bucket name. Buckets that have a period in the bucket name can cause certificate exception when accessing with HTTPS-based URLs.</li>
</ul>


<p>Object key naming tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use prefixes and <code>/</code> (or other delimiters) to logically group your objects. For example, <code>prog/java/arrays.html</code>. There is no hierarchy of objects (e.g., folder) or nested buckets in S3.

<ul>
<li>However, the Amazon S3 console supports the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/UG/FolderOperations.html">folder concept</a> for convenience and usability. Amazon S3 does this by using key name prefixes for objects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For performance and scalability, consider using hash as the outermost prefix, in addition to other logical grouping prefixes. See &ldquo;Programming Considerations&rdquo; section below.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Operations on Objects</h3>

<p>Basic operations on S3 objects and buckets are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Put: upload or copy object, up to 5 GB. You can use multi-part upload API for larger objects up to 5 TB.</li>
<li>Get: Retrieve a whole object or part of an object.</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ListingKeysHierarchy.html">List Keys</a>: List object keys by prefix and delimiter.</li>
<li>Delete: Delete one or more objects.

<ul>
<li>If versioning is not enabled, an object is permanently deleted by specifying its key.</li>
<li>If versioning is enabled, you delete an object by specifying a key and version ID. You must delete all versions of an object to remove it.</li>
<li>If versioning is enabled and version is not specified, S3 adds a delete marker to current version of the object. Trying to retrieve an object with a delete marker will returns a &ldquo;404 Not Found&rdquo; error by S3.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Restore: Restore an object archived on Amazon Glacier.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Other operations in S3</h4>

<p>Advanced operations that you should know when situations arise.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 1</strong>: You want to let users upload files to your buckets for some time duration.
<strong>Solution 1</strong>: You should never share your AWS credentials to let users upload files to your buckets.
Instead, generate a <strong>pre-signed URL</strong> with your security credentials, bucket name, object key, HTTP method (PUT or GET), and expiration date and time.
You share this pre-signed URL to users who will use this to access your S3 buckets.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 2</strong>: Encryption and strict data security is required.
<strong>Solution 2</strong>: You can enable:</p>

<ul>
<li>Securing data in transit.

<ul>
<li>SSL-encrypted data transfer by using HTTPS</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html">Client-side encryption</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Securing data at rest on AWS server.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html">Server-side encryption</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Scenario 3</strong>: You want your web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with S3 resources in a different domain.
<strong>Solution 3</strong>: Check out <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html">CORS</a>.</p>

<h3>Programming considerations</h3>

<ul>
<li>According to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/request-rate-perf-considerations.html">this guideline</a>, <strong>avoid</strong> using some sequential prefix (e.g., timestamp or alphabetical sequence) for your objects' key names. Instead, prefix the key name with its hash and, optionally, store the original key name in the object&rsquo;s metadata. See examples in the link for more information.</li>
<li>If your application uses fixed buckets, avoid unnecessary requests by checking the existence of buckets. Instead, handle <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html">NoSuchBucket errors</a> when buckets do not exist.</li>
<li>Set the object metadata before uploading an object. Otherwise, you will have extra requests to do copy operation to update metadata.</li>
<li>Cache bucket and key names if possible.</li>
<li>Set bucket region closest to latency-sensitive users.</li>
<li>Compress objects to reduce the size of data transferred and storage used.</li>
<li>Use an exponential back-off algorithm to retry after failed connection attempts. See <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/api-retries.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>Enable application logging. For example, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSdkDocsJava/latest/DeveloperGuide/java-dg-logging.html">in Java</a>.</li>
<li>Enable <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.html">server access logging</a>.</li>
</ul>
