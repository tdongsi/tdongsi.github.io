    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post explains a work-around for pinging hosts in network where ICMP requests are blocked.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>There are times that we can <code>ssh</code> to our servers but simply can&rsquo;t <code>ping</code> those servers.</p>

<pre><code class="plain ssh works but ping fails">tdongsi$ ping 10.252.158.71

</code></pre>

<p>One possible explanation of seemingly perplexing situation like above is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol">ICMP requests</a> (i.e., ping) are blocked.
It is not unheard of that an ISP or a network administrator blocks ICMP requests.
To work around that limitation, you can use a &ldquo;TCP ping&rdquo; on a port, using a tool like <code>nmap</code>.
The following examples check if a host can be reached via port 80:</p>

<pre><code class="plain "TCP ping" with nmap: success and failure.">tdongsi$ nmap -sn -PS80 10.252.158.71

Starting Nmap 7.40 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-03-03 17:17 PST
Nmap scan report for master-1 (10.252.158.71)
Host is up (0.051s latency).
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.06 seconds

tdongsi$ nmap -sn -PS80 master-2

Starting Nmap 7.40 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-10-09 14:35 PDT
Note: Host seems down. If it is really up, but blocking our ping probes, try -Pn
Nmap done: 1 IP address (0 hosts up) scanned in 2.02 seconds

    <link href="http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2017/08/06/github-rest-api/"/>
    <updated>2017-08-06T21:37:20-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2017/08/06/github-rest-api</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The blog post shows some useful snippets for interacting with Github API.
Jenkins pipelines regularly interacts with Github (public or Enterprise) API to perform some query/posting, for example, regarding the current pull request.
For that reason, some of the following snippets are either in Groovy or <code>curl</code> commands embedded in Groovy-based Jenkinsfile code with some Jenkinsfile DSLs.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Working with Pull Requests</h3>

<h4>Extracting Pull Request details</h4>

<pre><code class="groovy Get PR body text">import groovy.json.JsonSlurper

def getPrBody(String githubUsername, String githubToken, String repo, String id) {
  String GITHUB_API = 'https://git.enterprise.com/api/v3/repos'

  String url = "${GITHUB_API}/${githubUsername}/${repo}/pulls/${id}"
  println "Querying ${url}"
  def text = url.toURL().getText(requestProperties: ['Authorization': "token ${githubToken}"])
  def json = new JsonSlurper().parseText(text)
  def bodyText = json.body

  return bodyText
}
</code></pre>

<p>The equivalent <code>curl</code> command is as follows, with JSON processing is done in <code>jq</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="groovy Equivalent curl | jq command in Jenkisfile">sh """
curl -s -H "Authorization: token ${env.GITHUB_TOKEN}" ${GITHUB_API}/${org}/${repo}/pulls/${env.CHANGE_ID} | jq '.body' -r &gt; pr_body.txt
"""
</code></pre>

<h4>Posting comment on the Pull Request</h4>

<p>Reference: <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/comments/#create-a-comment">Create a comment</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="groovy Equivalent curl in Jenkinsfile">sh """
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: token ${env.GITHUB_TOKEN}" --data '{"body": "${comment}"}' ${GITHUB_API}/${org}/${repo}/issues/${env.CHANGE_ID}/comments
"""
</code></pre>

<h4>Merge Pull Request</h4>

<p>Based on <a href="http://www.cloudypoint.com/Tutorials/discussion/jenkins-solved-how-to-merge-a-successful-build-of-a-pull-request-using-a-jenkinsfile/">this article</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="groovy Merge pull request">stage ("Merge PR") {
    steps { 
        withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'credential-value', usernameVariable: 'ACCESS_TOKEN_USERNAME', passwordVariable: 'ACCESS_TOKEN_PASSWORD',)]) {
            def GITHUB = 'https://github.ibm.com/api/v3/repos'
            sh "curl -X PUT -d '{\"commit_title\": \"Merge pull request\"}' ${GITHUB}/org-name/repo-name/pulls/${env.CHANGE_ID}/merge?access_token=${env.ACCESS_TOKEN_PASSWORD}"
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Jenkins-provided environment variable <code>$CHANGE_ID</code>, in the case of a pull request, is the pull request number.</p>

<h3>Working with Branches</h3>

<h4>Getting email of branch maintainer</h4>

<p>At the end of a Jenkins build for a feature branch (NOT <code>develop</code>/<code>master</code>), you may want to email some developer of its status, as opposed to blasting a whole distribution list.
Note that in Git, there is no such metadata for branch creator, as discussed <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12055198/find-out-git-branch-creator/19135644">here</a>.
Instead, it makes more sense to notify the latest/active committer which is likely the owner of the branch.</p>

<!--
Furthermore, while most of the branches in Git has short lifetime, some branches such as `master` and `develop` can stay around for a long time.
That person may be not active or leave the project entirely.
-->


<pre><code class="groovy Get email of branch maintainer.">def getBranchCreator(String githubUsername, String githubToken, String repo, String branch) {
    String GITHUB_API = 'https://git.enterprise.com/api/v3/repos'

    String url = "${GITHUB_API}/${githubUsername}/${repo}/branches/${branch}"
    println "Querying ${url}"
    def text = url.toURL().getText(requestProperties: ['Authorization': "token ${githubToken}"])
    def json = new JsonSlurper().parseText(text)

    // Get last committer.
    def creator = json.commit.commit.committer.email
    // TRICKY: json.commit.commit.committer.email is not valid if someone commits from Github web interface.
    // In the case, committer name is 'GitHub Enterprise'.
    if (json.commit.commit.committer.name == 'GitHub Enterprise') {
    // Use author's email instead
    creator = json.commit.commit.author.email
    }
    // TRICKY: the following can return inconsistent data, including "null".
    // def author = json.author
    return creator
}

// Calling from Jenkinsfile
withCredentials([
    [$class: 'UsernamePasswordMultiBinding', credentialsId: 'my-credentials', 
        passwordVariable: 'GITHUB_PASSWORD', usernameVariable: 'GITHUB_USERNAME']
]) {
    if (env.BRANCH_NAME ==~ /PR-\d+/ ) {
        // If it is a PR build, use some distribution list
        email = 'someemail@enterprise.com'
    } else {
        // NOTE: Replace env.GITHUB_USERNAME with the correct Github org name.
        email = getBranchCreator(env.GITHUB_USERNAME, env.GITHUB_PASSWORD, 'my_repo', env.BRANCH_NAME)
    }
}  
</code></pre>

<h4>Deleting a branch</h4>

<p>Searching how to delete a branch in Github API&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/branches/">Branches reference</a> does not return anything.
In fact, to delete a branch, we have to delete its HEAD reference as shown <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/git/refs/#delete-a-reference">here</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="plain Deleting a branch">DELETE /repos/octocat/Hello-World/git/refs/heads/feature-a
</code></pre>

<h3>More tips on Github API</h3>

<p>1) When processing data from Github API, note that any commit has an author and a committer, as shown below.</p>

<pre><code class="json Example commit data">        "commit": {
            "author": {
                "name": "Cuong Dong-Si",
                "email": "tdongsi@example.com",
                "date": "2017-08-17T05:33:46Z"
            },
            "committer": {
                "name": "Tue-Cuong Dong-Si",
                "email": "tdongsi@example.com",
                "date": "2017-08-17T05:33:46Z"
            },
            "message": "@JIRA-4214772@: Add function.",
            "tree": {
                "sha": "xxx",
                "url": "xxx"
            },
            "url": "xxx",
            "comment_count": 0
        },
</code></pre>

<p>While the two fields are usually the same in normal commits (with same associated email and timestamp), they have different meanings.
In summary, the author is the one who created the content, and the committer is the one who committed it.
The two fields can be different in some common Github workflows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Commit a change from Github web interface: The author is the logged-in user (e.g., tdongsi) but the &ldquo;committer&rdquo; field usually has the Github default name and email, e.g., &ldquo;Github Enterprise&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x6e;&#111;&#45;&#114;&#x65;&#x70;&#x6c;&#x79;&#64;&#103;&#x69;&#x74;&#104;&#117;&#98;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;">&#110;&#111;&#45;&#x72;&#x65;&#x70;&#x6c;&#x79;&#64;&#x67;&#105;&#116;&#x68;&#117;&#98;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;</a>&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Make and/or merge a pull request from Github: For example, Alice submitted a pull request which was accepted and then merged by Betty (the repository owner). In that case, the author is Alice and the committer is Betty.</li>
</ul>


<p>Due to that subtle difference in committer and author in different scenarios, one has to be careful when using data sent by Github API in a Jenkins pipeline.
For example, you want to send email to the repository owner (committer) at the end of a Pull Request build, but what if someone adds a commit via Github web interface (commiter email would be &ldquo;<a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#x6f;&#58;&#110;&#111;&#x2d;&#x72;&#x65;&#x70;&#x6c;&#x79;&#64;&#103;&#105;&#116;&#x68;&#117;&#x62;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#110;&#x6f;&#x2d;&#x72;&#101;&#112;&#108;&#121;&#64;&#x67;&#x69;&#116;&#x68;&#x75;&#98;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;</a>&rdquo; which is not helpful).</p>

<p>2) There is an API rate limit for the free public Github API (note &ldquo;X-RateLimit-Limit&rdquo; and &ldquo;X-RateLimit-Remaining&rdquo; in output below).</p>

<pre><code class="plain Github API limit">tdongsi-mac:dev tdongsi$ curl -i https://api.github.com/users/tdongsi

<p>You are likely to hit this rate limit quickly if you are polling the repos for updates.
Instead of polling from your CI (e.g., Jenkins) system, it is recommended to use <a href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/">Github webhooks</a>.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Bash Trap]]></title>
    <link href="http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2016/03/02/bash-trap/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-02T00:07:48-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2016/03/02/bash-trap</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post, we discuss common usage of bash <code>trap</code> to ensure proper cleanup operations in Bash scripts.
It also discusses a common idiom <code>trap cleanup INT TERM EXIT</code> where other signals such as INT and TERM is also trapped in addition to EXIT.
While such idiom could be valid in some Unix system, it is usually redundant and can be simply wrong (duplicate executions) in most cases, as shown on Mac.
A simple test is provided to verify if such idiom is applicable in your current system.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Standard usage</h3>

<p>There is a simple idiom to ensure your bash scripts to always do proper cleanup operations before exiting, even when something goes wrong during execution.
In the context of Java or Python, this is similar to a <code>finally</code> clause that will execute after any exception is caught during execution.</p>

<pre><code class="bash DO THIS"># Setup trap to cleanup before exiting script
function cleanup {
    echo "Removing temp files..."
    if [[ -f $CMD_TMPFILE ]] ; then
        rm $CMD_TMPFILE
    fi
    if [[ -f $LOG_TMPFILE ]] ; then
        rm $LOG_TMPFILE
    fi
}
trap cleanup EXIT

# Setup

# Thousand lines of code here
</code></pre>

<p>Putting the cleanup operations at the end of the bash script might not work in cases of error.
Since the bash script already stops executing due to some fatal error, those clean up commands might never run.</p>

<pre><code class="bash DON'T DO THIS">
# Setup

# Thousand lines of code here

# This might not run when there is error
echo "Removing temp files..."
if [[ -f $CMD_TMPFILE ]] ; then
    rm $CMD_TMPFILE
fi
if [[ -f $LOG_TMPFILE ]] ; then
    rm $LOG_TMPFILE
fi
</code></pre>

<p>For example, in Vertica, you should always run <a href="https://my.vertica.com/docs/7.1.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/SQLReferenceManual/Functions/VerticaFunctions/START_REFRESH.htm"><code>SELECT START_REFRESH()</code></a>
at the end of a deployment script, regardless of any error encountered during script execution.
It is a good candidate for using <code>trap</code> statement.
Adding those commands at the end of the script will not work in cases there is an error during deployment, and you might end up with &ldquo;AHM Does Not Advance&rdquo;-related errors (see this <a href="/blog/2016/02/29/vertica-9-refresh-projections/">post</a>).</p>

<h3>Trap multiple signals</h3>

<p>Note that many online examples for <code>trap</code> use a list of signals for cleanup tasks like this <code>trap cleanup INT TERM EXIT</code>, i.e., trapping not only EXIT signal but also INT and TERM signals.
I believe that if <code>EXIT</code> signal is used, other signals such as <code>INT</code> or <code>TERM</code> are redundant for cleanup purposes.
<code>EXIT</code> or 0 signal is invoked when the shell exits, an event that also happens when an <code>INT</code> or <code>TERM</code> signal is received.
It is easy to confirm that with the following short bash script:</p>

<pre><code class="plain Trap tests in Mac OSX">MTVL1288aeea2-82:code tdongsi$ cat test_trap.sh
#!/bin/bash
trap 'echo SIGNAL CAPTURED' EXIT
sleep 3

MTVL1288aeea2-82:code tdongsi$ ./test_trap.sh &amp; sleep 1; kill -INT %1
[1] 6613
SIGNAL CAPTURED
[1]+  Interrupt: 2            ./test_trap.sh

MTVL1288aeea2-82:code tdongsi$ ./test_trap.sh &amp; sleep 1; kill -TERM %1
[1] 6624
SIGNAL CAPTURED
[1]+  Terminated: 15          ./test_trap.sh
</code></pre>

<p>As shown above, a lone <code>EXIT</code> is enough to capture <code>INT</code> and <code>TERM</code> signals.
Having said that, I understand that my tests can only verify bash on Mac OSX.
There are probably different shell variants on different operating systems which do not always work that way.</p>

<p>The problem of those <code>trap</code> examples lies in when someone copies and uses the code directly from the web, without understanding how it works.
Listing multiple signals can make the <code>cleanup</code> steps executed twice, once for the signal such as <code>TERM</code> and once for <code>EXIT</code>, as shown in the modified experiment below.
Not all cleanup steps could be and should be executed twice.
For example, it is almost always true that removing some temporary file/folder should not be executed twice during a cleanup.</p>

<pre><code class="plain Problem of trapping multiple signals">MTVL1288aeea2-82:code tdongsi$ cat test_trap.sh
#!/bin/bash
trap 'echo SIGNAL CAPTURED' INT TERM EXIT
sleep 3

MTVL1288aeea2-82:code tdongsi$ ./test_trap.sh &amp; sleep 1; kill -INT %1
[1] 7258
SIGNAL CAPTURED
SIGNAL CAPTURED
[1]+  Exit 130                ./test_trap.sh

MTVL1288aeea2-82:code tdongsi$ ./test_trap.sh &amp; sleep 1; kill -TERM %1
[1] 7278
Terminated: 15
SIGNAL CAPTURED
SIGNAL CAPTURED
[1]+  Exit 143                ./test_trap.sh
</code></pre>

<p>In short, you should know how <code>trap</code> works on your production system before listing multiple signals as its parameters, especially when coupled with <code>EXIT</code> signal.</p>

<h3>Other usage notes</h3>

<p>The signal names might be specified with or without prefix <code>SIG</code> or even with numeric values for signal numbers, e.g., 2 for INT (see list below).</p>

<pre><code class="plain List of signals">MTVL1288aeea2-82:octopress tdongsi$ kill -l
 1) SIGHUP   2) SIGINT   3) SIGQUIT  4) SIGILL
 5) SIGTRAP  6) SIGABRT  7) SIGEMT   8) SIGFPE
 9) SIGKILL 10) SIGBUS  11) SIGSEGV 12) SIGSYS
13) SIGPIPE 14) SIGALRM 15) SIGTERM 16) SIGURG
17) SIGSTOP 18) SIGTSTP 19) SIGCONT 20) SIGCHLD
21) SIGTTIN 22) SIGTTOU 23) SIGIO   24) SIGXCPU
25) SIGXFSZ 26) SIGVTALRM   27) SIGPROF 28) SIGWINCH
29) SIGINFO 30) SIGUSR1 31) SIGUSR2

OR 

MTVL1288aeea2-82:octopress tdongsi$ man signal
</code></pre>

<p>If one of the signals specified in <code>trap</code> statement is <code>DEBUG</code>, the list of COMMANDS specified in <code>trap</code> statement will be executed after every simple command.
This is useful for debugging purpose.
The following example is taken from <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/chap_12.html">here</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="bash Tracing when a variable is used">declare -t VARIABLE=value
trap "echo VARIABLE is being used here." DEBUG

# rest of the script
</code></pre>

    <link href="http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2016/02/20/symlinks-in-git/"/>
    <updated>2016-02-20T11:28:11-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2016/02/20/symlinks-in-git</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let&rsquo;s say we have folders with many symbolic links in them, linking to other files in the same Git repository.</p>

<pre><code class="bash Before">$ ls -l link
... link -&gt; /path/to/target
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately after committing into Git, they&rsquo;ve turned into plain text files.
Note that even after committing and pushing into Git, the symlinks still work fine.
However, after some branch switches and code merges, the symlinks become actual text files with the link target as the contents.</p>

<pre><code class="bash After">$ cat link
/path/to/target
</code></pre>

<!--more-->


<h3>Restoring the symlinks</h3>

<p>Before going into lengthy discussion on how Git handles symlinks and hard links, the quick solution for the above problem is the following Bash script:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">folder=/Users/tdongsi/Github/my_repo/scripts/sql
ls -d1 $folder/* | while read f; do
  ln -sf "$(cat $f)" "$f"
done
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>ls -d1 $folder/*</code> should be replaced with some command that will list exactly the files you want, preferably in full path.
Note that <code>-f</code> option of <code>ln</code> command is required to replace the file with the symlink. For examples:</p>

<pre><code class="bash Examples">ls -d1 vertica/*.sql | while read f; do
  ln -sf "$(cat $f)" "$f"
done

ls -d1 bash/* | while read f; do
  ln -sf "$(cat $f)" "$f"
done
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Best practice note</strong>: I think that the following template is preferred to the more commonly seen <code>for f in $(ls *);</code> <code>do...done</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">ls * | while read f; do
  # command executed for each file
done
</code></pre>

<p>I think it is the better way to handle all file names, especially with spaces, since <code>"$f"</code> will still work.
In addition, <code>$(cmd)</code> is the same as <code>'cmd'</code> (backticks) but it can be nested, unlike using backticks.
It fact, it&rsquo;s the main reason why the backticks have been <a href="http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/obsolete">deprecated</a> from Bash scripting.</p>

<h3>How Git deals with symlinks</h3>

<p>How Git deals with symlinks is defined in the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config">git config</a> <code>core.symlinks</code>.
If false, symbolic links are checked out as small plain files that contain the link text.
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/954560/how-does-git-handle-symbolic-links">Otherwise</a>, Git just stores the contents of the link (i.e., the path of the file system) in a &lsquo;blob&rsquo; just like it would for a normal file.
It also stores the name, mode and type (e.g., symlink) in the tree object that represents its containing directory.
When you checkout a tree containing the link, it restores the object as a symlink.</p>

<p>After the symlinks are checked out as plain text files, I believe it is pretty much no way for Git to restore symlinks again (i.e., follow symlinks inside text files).
It would be an insecure, undefined behavior: what if the symlink as text file is modified? What if the target is changed when moving between versions of that text file?</p>

<h3>Use hard links?</h3>

<p>You can use hard links instead of symlinks (a.k.a., soft links).
Git will handle a hard link like a copy of the file, except that the contents of the linked files change at the same time.
Git may see changes in both files if both the original file and the hard link are in the same repository.</p>

<p>One of the disadvantages is that the file will be created as a normal file during <code>git checkout</code>, because there is no way Git understand it as a link.
Moreover, hard link itself has many limitations, compared to symlinks, such as files have to reside on the same file-system or partition.
In Mac OSX, hard links to directories are not supported. There is a <a href="https://github.com/selkhateeb/hardlink">tool</a> to do that, but use it with caution.</p>

<p>Finally, it is important to note that hard links to files can be lost when moving between different versions/branches in Git, even if they are in the same repository.
When you switch branches back and forth, Git remove the old files and create new ones.
You still have the copies of the previous files, but they might have totally different inodes, while others (if not in the same Git repo) still refers to the old inodes.
Eventually, the file and its hard links may be out of sync, and appear like totally unrelated files to Git.
Therefore, using hard links, at best, is just a temporary solution.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When developing data-warehouse solutions in Vertica, you want to set up some test environment.
Ideally, you should have separate schema for each developer.
However, it is usually NOT possible in my experience: developers and test engineers have to share very few schemas in development environment.
The explanation that I usually get is that having a schema for each developer will not scale in database maintenance and administration, and there are likely some limits in Vertica&rsquo;s commercial license.
If that is the case, I recommend that we look into using Vertica Community Edition on <strong>Virtual Machines (VMs)</strong> for sandbox test environment, as a cheap alternative.</p>

<h3>Vertica Virtual Machine as sandbox test environment</h3>

<p>Are VMs really necessary in data-warehouse testing? When testing Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes, I find that many of test cases require regular set-up and tear-down, adding mock records to force rare logical branches and corner cases, and/or running ETLs multiple times to simulate daily runs of those processes.
Regular tear-down requires dropping multiple tables regularly, which requires much greater care and drains much mental energy when working with others' data and tables.
Similarly, adding mock records into some commonly shared tables might affect others when they assume the data is production-like.
Running ETL scripts regularly, which could be computationally intensive, on a shared Vertica cluster might affect the performance or get affected by others' processes.
In short, for these tests, I cannot use the common schema that is shared with others since it might interfere others and/or destroy valuable common data.
Using a Vertica VM as the sandbox test environment helps us minimize interference to and from others' data and activities.</p>

<h3>Single-node VM and KSAFE clause</h3>

<p>I have been using a <strong>single-node</strong> Vertica VM to run tests for sometime. And it works wonderfully for testing purpose, especially when you want to isolate issues, for example, a corner case. The Vertica VM can be downloaded from HP Vertica&rsquo;s support website (NOTE: As of 2016 Jan 1st, the Vertica 7.1 VM is taken down while the Vertica 7.2 VM is not available).</p>

<p>The only minor problem is when we add <code>KSAFE 1</code> in our DDL scripts (i.e., <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statements) for production purposes. This gives error on single-node VM when running DDL scripts to set up schema.
The reason is that Vertica database with one or two hosts cannot be <em>k-safe</em> (i.e., it may lose data if it crashes) and three-node cluster is the minimum requirement to have <code>KSAFE 1</code> in <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statements to work.</p>

<p>Even then, the workaround for running those DDL scripts in tests is easy enough if all DDL scripts are all located in a single folder. The idea is that since <code>KSAFE 1</code> does not affect ETL processes' transform logics, we can remove those KSAFE clauses to set up the test schema and go ahead with our ETL testing. Specifically, in my project, my workflow for ETL testing with <strong>Git</strong> is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Branch the latest code (<code>develop</code> branch) into a temporary branch (e.g., <code>local/develop</code> branch).</li>
<li>Find and remove <code>KSAFE 1</code> in all DDL files (see subsection below).</li>
<li>While still in <code>local/develop</code> branch, commit all these changes in a <strong>single</strong> commit with some unique description (e.g., &ldquo;KSAFE REMOVAL&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Add unit and functional tests to ETL scripts in this branch.</li>
<li>After tests are properly developed and checked-in, reverse the &ldquo;KSAFE REMOVAL&rdquo; commit above.

<ul>
<li>In SourceTree, it could be done by a simple right-click on that commit and selecting &ldquo;Reverse Commit&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Merge <code>local/develop</code> branch into <code>develop</code> branch (create a pull request if needed). You will now have your tests with the latest codes in <code>develop</code> branch.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Find and replace a string in multiple files</h4>

<p>There are times and times again that you find that you have to replace every single occurrences of some string in multiple files with another string. Finding and removing <code>KSAFE 1</code> like the above workflow is an example where &ldquo;removing string&rdquo; is a special case of &ldquo;replacing string&rdquo; with nothing. This operation can be quickly done by the following bash command:</p>

<pre><code>grep -rl match_string your_dir/ | xargs sed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g'
</code></pre>

<p>If you are familiar with bash scripting, the above command is straight forward. This quick explanation is for anyone who does not understand the command:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>grep</code> command finds all files in <code>your_dir</code> directory that contain <code>match_string</code>. <code>-l</code> option makes sure it will return a list of files</li>
<li><code>sed</code> command then execute the replacement regex on all those files. A regex tip: the forward slash <code>/</code> delimiter could be another delimiter (e.g., <code>#</code>). This might be useful if you need to search HTML files.</li>
</ul>


<p>Example: In my case, all the DDL scripts are in multiple sub-directories under <code>tables</code> directory. To find and remove all <code>KSAFE 1</code> occurrences, the command is:</p>

<pre><code>grep -rl 'KSAFE 1' tables | xargs sed -i 's/KSAFE 1//g'
</code></pre>

<p>This will search for the string <code>KSAFE 1</code> in all files in the <code>tables</code> directory and replace <code>KSAFE 1</code> with nothing <code>''</code> for each occurrence of the string in each file.</p>
