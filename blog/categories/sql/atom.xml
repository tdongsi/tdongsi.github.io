    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>MySQL has traditionally lagged behind in support for the SQL standard.
Unfortunately, from my experience, MySQL is often used as the sandbox for SQL code challenges and interviews.
If you are used to work with <a href="https://my.vertica.com/docs/7.1.x/HTML/index.htm#Authoring/SQLReferenceManual/SQLReferenceManual.htm">Vertica SQL</a>, writing SQL statements in MySQL can be challenging exercises, NOT necessarily in a good way, because many useful features are not supported.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>WITH clause</h3>

<p>As discussed in this <a href="/blog/2016/02/03/vertica-6-with-clause/">blog post</a>, <code>WITH</code> clause syntax, also known as <em>Common Table Expressions</em> (CTE), is thankfully supported in Vertica.
In summary, <code>WITH</code> clause allows us to arrange sub-queries, usually intermediate steps, in a complex SQL query in sequential, logical order.
This will make the complex queries easier to compose and read: we can write steps by steps of the query from top to bottom like a story (i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a>).
Unfortunately, <code>WITH</code> clause is not supported by MySQL although this feature has been requested since <a href="https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=16244">2006</a>.
There are <a href="http://guilhembichot.blogspot.fr/2013/11/with-recursive-and-mysql.html">work-arounds</a> for MySQL&rsquo;s lack of CTE, but the easiest way is probably to revert back to using nested subqueries.</p>

<p>Personally, lack of <code>WITH</code> clause support in MySQL is my greatest hindrance as I often ended up writing queries using <code>WITH</code> clauses as first draft before rewriting those queries using nested subqueries.
This might appear clumsy in SQL interviews even though writing SQL codes with CTE instead of subqueries is the recommended practice for maintainable code.</p>

<h3>Analytic functions</h3>

<p>Another regrettable hindrance when working in MySQL is its lack of analytic functions such as <code>ROW_NUMBER</code>, <code>RANK</code> and <code>DENSE_RANK</code>.
Those <a href="https://my.vertica.com/docs/7.1.x/HTML/index.htm#Authoring/SQLReferenceManual/Functions/Analytic/AnalyticFunctions.htm">analytic functions</a> are supported in Vertica.
The difference between these three functions can be a bit subtle, and would be best described in the following example:</p>

<pre><code class="sql Example of ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK functions">SELECT customer_name, SUM(annual_income),
ROW_NUMBER () OVER (ORDER BY TO_CHAR(SUM(annual_income),'100000') DESC) row_number, 
RANK () OVER (ORDER BY TO_CHAR(SUM(annual_income),'100000') DESC) rank, 
DENSE_RANK () OVER (ORDER BY TO_CHAR(SUM(annual_income),'100000') DESC) dense_rank 
FROM customer_dimension
GROUP BY customer_name
LIMIT 15;
</code></pre>

<p>The outputs of these functions are only different if there are duplicates in <code>SUM(annual_income)</code> value, as seen in rows 75-81 in the example output below:</p>

<table border="1"><tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF"><th>customer_name</th><th>SUM</th><th>row_number</th><th>rank</th><th>dense_rank</th></tr>
<tr><td>Theodore R. King</td><td>97444</td><td>71</td><td>71</td><td>71</td></tr>
<tr><td>Laura Y. Pavlov</td><td>97417</td><td>72</td><td>72</td><td>72</td></tr>
<tr><td>Carla . Garcia</td><td>97371</td><td>73</td><td>73</td><td>73</td></tr>
<tr><td>Jack Z. Miller</td><td>97356</td><td>74</td><td>74</td><td>74</td></tr>
<tr><td>Steve W. Williams</td><td>97343</td><td>75</td><td>75</td><td>75</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lauren Y. Rodriguez</td><td>97343</td><td>76</td><td>75</td><td>75</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lucas . Webber</td><td>97318</td><td>77</td><td>77</td><td>76</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sarah N. Moore</td><td>97243</td><td>78</td><td>78</td><td>77</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lucas O. Li</td><td>97184</td><td>79</td><td>79</td><td>78</td></tr>
<tr><td>Doug K. Reyes</td><td>97166</td><td>80</td><td>80</td><td>79</td></tr>
<tr><td>Michael . Weaver</td><td>97162</td><td>81</td><td>81</td><td>80</td></tr>
</table>


<p><br/></p>

<p>Sadly, these useful analytic functions are not supported in MySQL.
Fortunately, MySQL supports user variables in SQL queries and we can reproduce those functionalities in MySQL using variables and subqueries as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="sql ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK functions in MySQL">-- In Vertica
SELECT 
ROW_NUMBER () OVER (PARTITION BY col_1, col_2 ORDER BY col_3 DESC) AS row_number,
RANK () OVER (PARTITION BY col_1, col_2 ORDER BY col_3 DESC) AS rank,
DENSE_RANK () OVER (PARTITION BY col_1, col_2 ORDER BY col_3 DESC) AS dense_rank,
t.* 
FROM table_1 t

-- In MySQL
SELECT
@row_num:=IF(@prev_col_1=t.col_1 AND @prev_col_2=t.col_2, @row_num+1, 1) AS row_number,
@rank:=IF(@prev_col_1=t.col_1 AND @prev_col_2=t.col_2 AND @prev_col_3=col_3, @rank, @row_num) AS rank,
@dense:=IF(@prev_col_1=t.col_1 AND @prev_col_2=t.col_2, IF(@prev_col_3=col_3, @dense, @dense+1), 1) AS dense_rank,
@prev_col_1 = t.col_1,
@prev_col_2 = t.col_2,
@prev_col_3 = t.col_3,
t.*
FROM (SELECT * FROM table_1 ORDER BY col_1, col_2, col_3 DESC) t,
     (SELECT @row_num:=1, @dense:=1, @rank:=1, @prev_col_1:=NULL, @prev_col_2:=NULL, @prev_col_3:=NULL) var
</code></pre>

<p>The MySQL work-around is intentionally generic so that I can adapt it to any use case.
In addition, it intentionally has a single pass (no <code>SET</code> statements, temporary table) since most SQL code challenges expect a single query.
Finally, note that the above MySQL solution is intentionally incomplete to make it less convoluted.
You need to put that solution in a subquery and <code>SELECT</code> only relevant columns from it.</p>

<p>As an example, the above code template is used to solve <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-scores/">this Rank Scores problem</a>.
In summary, the question asks for <code>DENSE_RANK</code> functionality to be applied on Score column.</p>

<pre><code class="plain Input table">+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="plain Expected output">+-------+------+
| Score | Rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+
</code></pre>

<p>The solution in Vertica SQL would be straight-forward as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="sql Solution in Vertica SQL">select Score,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Score DESC) AS Rank
FROM Scores;
</code></pre>

<p>In MySQL, apply the above code template and note that there is no <code>partition clause</code> to arrive at the following solution:</p>

<pre><code class="sql Solution in MySQL">SELECT Score, Rank FROM
( SELECT t.Score,
@dense:=IF(@prev_col2=t.Score, @dense, @dense+1) AS Rank,
@prev_col2:=t.Score
FROM (SELECT Score FROM Scores ORDER BY Score DESC) t, 
(SELECT @dense:=0, @prev_col2:=NULL) var ) x
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the outer <code>SELECT</code> is used to only expose only columns of interest while the main SQL code is enclosed in a subquery.</p>

<h3><code>NOT IN</code> better than <code>NOT EXISTS</code></h3>

<p>When we want to insert a row into a dimension table AND check for duplicates at the same time, we usually do this in DML scripts:</p>

<pre><code class="sql BAD">SELECT 'United States', 'English' 
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 'x' FROM dim_country WHERE country_name = 'United States')
</code></pre>

<p>However, for all such inserts, we were recently informed that it is better <strong>in Vertica</strong> to do <code>NOT IN</code> instead of <code>NOT EXISTS</code>.
So, for example above:</p>

<pre><code class="sql GOOD">SELECT 'United States', 'English' 
WHERE 'United States' NOT IN (select country_name from dim_country)
</code></pre>

<h3>Avoid using <code>LEFT JOIN</code> to check existence</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say we have an ETL that regularly inserts new data into an existing dimension table.</p>

<pre><code class="sql BAD">INSERT INTO dim_country                    
(
    country_id,
    country_name,
    country_language,
) 
SELECT ssp.country_id,
    ssp.country_name,
    ssp.country_language,
FROM staging_table ssp
LEFT JOIN dim_country dc on dc.country_id=ssp.country_id
WHERE dc.country_id is NULL;
</code></pre>

<p>We are sometimes doing <code>LEFT JOIN</code> like this only to determine whether or not an entry already exists in the table.
It would be faster to use a <code>WHERE</code> clause instead to perform that existence check.
Although it might sound counter-intuitive, but reducing <code>JOIN</code> operations like this has been regularly recommended.</p>

<pre><code class="sql GOOD">INSERT INTO dim_country                    
(
    country_id,
    country_name,
    country_language,
) 
SELECT ssp.country_id,
    ssp.country_name,
    ssp.country_language,
FROM staging_table ssp
WHERE ssp.country_id NOT IN (SELECT country_id FROM dim_country);
</code></pre>

<h3>Avoid function calls in <code>WHERE</code> and <code>JOIN</code> clauses</h3>

<p>For this performance tip, we make a slight change to the example ETL in the last section above where <code>country_id</code> column is removed. In this case, we can use a normalized <code>country_name</code> as the ID to check for existing entries in the table:</p>

<pre><code class="sql BAD">INSERT INTO dim_country                    
(
    country_name,
    country_language,
) SELECT ssp.country_name,
    ssp.country_language,
FROM staging_table ssp
LEFT JOIN dim_country dc on lower(dc.country_name)=lower(ssp.country_name)
WHERE dc.country_name is NULL;
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, we normalize <code>country_name</code> to lower case. Note that <code>WHERE</code> clause should be used instead of <code>LEFT JOIN</code> as discussed above.</p>

<pre><code class="sql BETTER, but still BAD">INSERT INTO dim_country                    
(
    country_name,
    country_language,
) SELECT ssp.country_name,
    ssp.country_language,
FROM staging_table ssp
WHERE lower(ssp.country_name) NOT IN (SELECT lower(country_name) FROM dim_country);;
</code></pre>

<p>However, such change still has bad performance because, in general, function calls in <code>WHERE</code> and <code>JOIN</code> clauses should be avoided in Vertica.
In both examples above, calling functions like <code>LOWER</code> in <code>WHERE</code> and <code>JOIN</code> clauses will affect the performance of the ETLs.</p>

<p>The solution for this scenario is that, since we control what goes into dimension tables, we can ensure that columns like <code>country_name</code> are always stored in lower-case.
Then, we can do the same when creating the temporary table such as <code>staging_table</code> that we are comparing to for checking existence.</p>

<h3>Use  <a href="https://my.vertica.com/docs/7.1.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/SQLReferenceManual/Functions/VerticaFunctions/ANALYZE_STATISTICS.htm">ANALYZE_STATISTICS</a></h3>

<p>Make sure to run <code>ANALYZE_STATISTICS</code> after all data loads.
Using this function, tables are analyzed for best performance in subsequent queries ran against it.
Without information from <code>ANALYZE_STATISTICS</code>, the query optimizer assumes uniform distribution of data values and equal storage usage for all projections.</p>

<p>Note that <code>ANALYZE_STATISTICS</code> is only supported on <em>local</em> temporary tables, but not on <em>global</em> temporary tables.
In addition, when we add <code>ANALYZE_STATISTICS</code> function calls into our ETL scripts, errors might be thrown when a second <code>ANALYZE_STATISTICS</code> call is made while the first is still running.
Those errors can be ignored but they must be caught accordingly to separate with other Vertica error messages.</p>

<h3>Avoid creating temporary tables using <code>SELECT</code></h3>

<p>Instead of creating temporary tables using <code>SELECT</code>, it is recommended to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create the temporary table first without a projection.</li>
<li>Create a super <a href="/blog/2016/02/07/vertica-post-7/">projection</a> with the correct column encodings and <code>ORDER BY</code> clause</li>
<li>Populate it using <code>INSERT /*+ direct */ INTO</code>. Note the <code>/*+ direct */</code> hint to write data directly to disk, bypassing memory.</li>
<li>Run <code>ANALYZE_STATISTICS</code>. See the last section.</li>
</ol>


<p>For example, in a Vertica ETL script that runs daily, we usually create a temporary table to retrieve the latest records from a source table like this:</p>

<pre><code class="sql BAD">CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE customer_last_temp 
ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS
AS(
  select * from (
    select *,
    row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY last_modify_date DESC) AS rank 
    from  stg_customer rpt 
  ) t1 where t1.rank =1
);
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, <code>last_modify_date</code> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture">CDC</a> column and <code>customer_id</code> is the primary key column.
Although this SQL statement is simple and easy to understand, it is really slow for a large and growing <code>stg_customer</code> table that contains updates to all customers on multiple dates, with millions of <em>new</em> customer entries each day.
Instead, the recommended coding pattern is to create a temporary table first without a projection:</p>

<pre><code class="sql Create a temporary table without projection">CREATE LOCAL TEMPORARY TABLE customer_last_temp  ( 
        customer_id                     int,
        subscribe_date                  timestamp,
        cancel_date                     timestamp,
        last_modify_date                timestamp,
)
ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS NO PROJECTION;
</code></pre>

<p>It is also recommended that the column names are explicitly specified, so that only required columns are created in the temporary table.
A <code>LOCAL</code> temporary table is created, instead of <code>GLOBAL</code>, so that we can use <code>ANALYZE_STATISTICS</code> functions as discussed above.
Next, create a super projection with the correct column encodings and <code>ORDER BY</code> clause:</p>

<pre><code class="sql Create a super projection">CREATE PROJECTION customer_last_temp_super (
      customer_id ENCODING DELTARANGE_COMP 
    , subscribe_date ENCODING GCDDELTA
    , cancel_date ENCODING BLOCKDICT_COMP     
    , last_modify_date ENCODING BLOCKDICT_COMP 
)
AS 
SELECT customer_id 
     , subscribe_date
     , cancel_date
     , last_modify_date
  FROM customer_last_temp 
 ORDER BY customer_id
SEGMENTED BY HASH (customer_id) ALL NODES;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, insert &ldquo;directly&rdquo; into the temporary table:</p>

<pre><code class="sql Populate the table">INSERT /*+ direct */ INTO customer_last_temp (
      customer_id 
    , subscribe_date 
    , cancel_date 
    , last_modify_date 
)
WITH t1 AS (
    SELECT company_id 
         , subscribe_date 
         , cancel_date 
         , last_modify_date 
         , ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id 
                                  ORDER BY last_modify_date DESC) AS rank 
      FROM stg_customer AS rpt 
)
SELECT company_id 
     , subscribe_date 
     , cancel_date 
     , last_modify_date 
FROM t1
WHERE t1.rank = 1;  
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>WITH</code> clause is just a more readable way to write the sub-query in the original SQL statement (see <a href="/blog/2016/02/03/vertica-post-8/">WITH clause</a>).
In addition, the wildcard <code>*</code> in the original SQL query is also avoided, in case the table <code>stg_customer</code> is a very wide table.</p>

    <link href="http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2016/02/03/vertica-6-with-clause/"/>
    <updated>2016-02-03T00:50:48-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2016/02/03/vertica-6-with-clause</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am pleasantly surprised that Vertica SQL supports <code>WITH</code> clause, as documented <a href="https://my.vertica.com/docs/7.1.x/HTML/index.htm#Authoring/AnalyzingData/Queries/WITHClausesInSELECT.htm">here</a>.
<code>WITH</code> syntax as a standard is only defined in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:1999">SQL-99</a>, also called <em>Common Table Expressions</em>.
Therefore, I do not usually expect <code>WITH</code> clause since it is a fairly recent feature in most SQL dialects.
For example: <code>WITH</code> clause support is only added into SQLite since Feb 2014.</p>

<p>In summary, the <code>WITH</code> clause allows us to arrange sub-queries in a SQL query in order of human logic.
This will make our query much easier to read: we can read from top to bottom like reading a story (i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a>).</p>

<!--more-->


<p>For example, we can look into the following <code>SELECT</code> query:</p>

<pre><code class="sql Hard to read">SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT *,
  row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY last_modify_date DESC) AS rank 
  FROM stg_customer
) sorted_by_modify_date where sorted_by_modify_date.rank =1
</code></pre>

<p>Before <code>WITH</code> clause, SQL scripts are usually hard to read due to nesting of sub-queries.
To understand a SQL statement, we have to find and understand the innermost sub-query first and start working from inside out.
In addition, as shown in the first example, name <code>sorted_by_modify_date</code> following the sub-query makes reading harder, even with meaningful names.
The longer the inner query gets, the more likely the name for that query is pushed out of sight despite the fact that it is important to see an intention revealing name before reading such inner query.</p>

<p>The above example can be made easier to read using <code>WITH</code> clause as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="sql Easy to read">WITH sorted_by_modify_date AS (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id 
                                  ORDER BY last_modify_date DESC) AS rank 
    FROM stg_customer
)
SELECT * FROM sorted_by_modify_date
WHERE sorted_by_modify_date.rank = 1;  
</code></pre>

<p>As the second example demonstrates, <code>WITH</code> clause solves two problems: 1) names come first, 2) sub-queries are un-nested.
The <code>WITH</code> clause puts the name above the code, like declaring a function with code in the sub-query.
We can pick a meaningful, intention revealing name for it and we can refer to that &ldquo;function&rdquo; in the following sub-queries in the same <code>WITH</code> clause.
Moreover, the most powerful impact of <code>WITH</code> clause is that sub-queries can be un-nested to follow the order and flow of developers' thoughts.
We can define multiple queries for multiple steps, and each of them can refer to the <em>previously</em> defined queries in the same <code>WITH</code> clause.</p>

<p>The following example demonstrates the power of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a> in SQL, enabled by <code>WITH</code> clause:</p>

<pre><code class="sql Traffic classification of a Music website">WITH Total_Traffic AS
(
    SELECT temp.* from temp as clickstream_data
    where .... -- filtering
)
, Rock_Music as
(
    select * from Total_Traffic
    WHERE lower(evar28) LIKE 'rock_mus%'
)
, Instrumental_Music as
(
    select * from Total
    WHERE evar28 LIKE '%[ins_mus]%'
)
, Defined_Traffic as
(
    select * from Rock_Music
    UNION
    select * from Instrumental_Music
)
select traffic_date_key
, count(distinct visitor_id) as unique_visitor
from Defined_Traffic 
group by traffic_date_key
</code></pre>

<p>The purpose of this query is to find the daily number of &ldquo;Defined&rdquo; unique visitors from clickstream data.
Finding daily total unique visitors from Clickstream data is easy and, by subtracting &ldquo;Defined&rdquo; numbers from &ldquo;Total&rdquo; numbers, we can find the &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo; traffic numbers that help determine marketing decisions.
Note that the total &ldquo;defined&rdquo; unique visitor count is NOT equal to sum of all unique visitor counts from each classification (e.g., &ldquo;Rock&rdquo; + &ldquo;Instrumental&rdquo;) since some visitors will listen to both Rock and Instrumental music on the website.</p>

<p>It would be hard, if not impossible, to write such query using only nested sub-queries and achieve the same readability.
The ease of reading is from a combination of top-down code structure and meaningful block names before code blocks, both are properties of <code>WITH</code> clause.</p>

<p>In the past, without <code>WITH</code> clause, we used to create <code>TEMPORARY TABLES</code> in Vertica to save the immediate steps.
Now, we have a native SQL solution in <code>WITH</code> clause and a more powerful technique to create sub-queries.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is a reminder of using Vertica&rsquo;s system tables for administrating and monitoring our own tables. One common house-cleaning operation when developing/testing in Vertica is to find and drop tables that are empty (truncated) and never used again.</p>

<p>You might ask why the tables are not dropped directly when I truncated the table in the first place. The answer is that all those tables have some specific designs on projection segmentation and partition, and those information will be lost if I drop the tables. These tables are frequently populated with data and cleared for testing purposes, and truncating and inserting with <code>direct</code> <a href="https://my.vertica.com/docs/7.1.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/SQLReferenceManual/Statements/INSERT.htm">hint</a> will give a significant performance boost (see <a href="/blog/2015/12/16/vertica-tip-best-practices/">Best practices</a>).</p>

<h3>v_monitor schema and COLUMN_STORAGE system table</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://my.vertica.com/docs/7.1.x/HTML/index.htm#Authoring/SQLReferenceManual/SystemTables/MONITOR/COLUMN_STORAGE.htm">COLUMN_STORAGE system table</a> in <code>v_monitor</code> schema returns the &ldquo;amount of disk storage used by each column of each projection on each node&rdquo;. Therefore, to get the size of each table, you only need to aggregate the <code>used_byte</code> data, grouped by schema name and table name.</p>

<pre><code class="sql Query to list tables' sizes in a schema">select anchor_table_schema, anchor_table_name, sum(used_bytes)
FROM v_monitor.column_storage
where anchor_table_schema = 'some_schema'
group by anchor_table_schema, anchor_table_name
</code></pre>

<p>According to <a href="http://vertica.tips/2014/01/25/table-size/">here</a>, the number from the above query is the <em>compressed</em> size of the Vertica tables. To get the <em>raw</em> size of the tables, which probably only matters for license limit, perform a <em>license audit</em>, and query the system table <code>license_audits</code> in <code>v_catalog</code> schema. However, the most important takeaway is that empty tables will not appear in this <code>COLUMN_STORAGE</code> system table.</p>

<h3>v_catalog schema and TABLES system table</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://my.vertica.com/docs/7.1.x/HTML/index.htm#Authoring/SQLReferenceManual/SystemTables/CATALOG/TABLES.htm">TABLES system table</a> is probably more well-known. It contains all the information about all the tables in all the schemas. For example, to list all the tables in some schema:</p>

<pre><code class="sql Query to list all tables in a schema">select table_schema, table_name from tables
where table_schema = 'some_schema'
</code></pre>

<p>Another useful system table in <code>v_catalog</code> schema is <code>USER_FUNCTIONS</code> which lists all user-defined functions and their function signatures in the database.</p>

<h3>Find all the empty (truncated) tables</h3>

<p>Having all the tables in <code>v_catalog.tables</code> table and only non-empty tables in <code>v_monitor.column_storage</code> table, finding empty tables is pretty straight-forward in SQL:</p>

<pre><code class="sql Query to find empty tables in a schema">select table_name
from v_catalog.tables
where table_schema = 'some_schema'
EXCEPT
select anchor_table_name
from v_monitor.column_storage
where anchor_table_schema = 'some_schema' 
</code></pre>

<h3>General Tips and Tricks</h3>

<h4>CREATE (INSERT)</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>If you want to write data directly to disk and bypass memory, then you should include <code>/*+ direct */</code> as a &ldquo;hint&rdquo; in your <code>INSERT</code> statement. This is especially helpful when you are loading data from big files into Vertica. If you don&rsquo;t use <code>/*+ direct */</code>, then <code>INSERT</code> statement first uses memory, which may be more useful when you want to optimally do inserts and run queries.</p></li>
<li><p>ALWAYS include <code>COMMIT</code> in your SQL statements when you are creating or updating Vertica schemas, because there is NO auto commit in Vertica.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are copying a table, <strong>DO NOT</strong> use <code>CREATE TABLE copy AS SELECT * FROM source</code>. This will give you a copy table with default projections and storage policy. Instead, you should use <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement with the <a href="https://my.vertica.com/docs/7.1.x/HTML/index.htm#Authoring/AdministratorsGuide/Tables/CreatingATableLikeAnother.htm"><code>LIKE existing_table</code> clause</a> and use <code>INSERT /*+ direct */</code> statement. Creating a table with <code>LIKE</code> option replicates the table definition and storage policy associated with the source table, which can make a significant difference in data loading performance. Note that the <code>LIKE</code> clause does not work if the existing source table is a temporary table.</p></li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="sql DO NOT do this">create table to_schema.to_table_name
as select * from from_schema.from_table_name;
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="sql DO this">CREATE TABLE to_schema.to_table_name LIKE from_schema.from_table_name INCLUDING PROJECTIONS;
INSERT /*+ direct */ INTO to_schema.to_table_name SELECT * from from_schema.from_table_name;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Before making a copy of a table, be sure to consider alternatives in order to execute optimal queries: create views, rewrite queries, use sub-queries, limit queries to only a subset of data for analysis.</li>
</ul>


<h4>READ</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Avoid joining large tables (e.g., > 50M records). Run a <code>count(*)</code> on tables before joining and use <code>MERGE JOIN</code> to optimally join tables. When you use smaller subsets of data, the Vertica Optimizer will pick the <code>MERGE JOIN</code> algorithm instead of the <code>HASH JOIN</code> one, which is less optimal.</p></li>
<li><p>When an approximate value will be enough, Vertica offers an alternative to <code>COUNT(DISTINCT)</code>: <code>APPROXIMATE_COUNT_DISTINCT</code>. This function is recommended when you have a large data set and you do not require an exact count of distinct values: e.g., sanity checks that verify the tables are populated. According to <a href="http://my.vertica.com/docs/7.1.x/HTML/index.htm#Authoring/AnalyzingData/Optimizations/OptimizingCOUNTDISTINCTByCalculatingApproximateCounts.htm">this documentation</a>, you can get much better performance than <code>COUNT(DISTINCT)</code>. <a href="http://my.vertica.com/docs/7.1.x/HTML/index.htm#Authoring/SQLReferenceManual/Functions/Aggregate/APPROXIMATE_COUNT_DISTINCT.htm">Here</a> is an example of the <code>APPROXIMATE_COUNT_DISTINCT</code> syntax that you should use.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>UPDATE &amp; DELETE</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Deletes and updates take exclusive locks on the table. Hence, only one <code>DELETE</code> or <code>UPDATE</code> transaction on that table can be in progress at a time and only when no <code>INSERTs</code> are in progress. Deletes and updates on different tables can be run concurrently.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to avoid <code>DELETE</code> or <code>UPDATE</code> as much as you can, especially on shared Vertica databases. Instead, it may work better to move the data you want to update to a new temporary table, work on that copy, drop the original table, and rename the temporary table with the original table name. For example:</p></li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="sql">CREATE temp_table LIKE src_table INCLUDING PROJECTIONS;
INSERT INTO temp_table (SELECT statement based on the updated data or the needed rows);
DROP TABLE src_table;
ALTER TABLE temp_table RENAME TO src_table;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Delete from tables marks rows with delete vectors and stores them so data can be rolled back to a previous epoch. The data must be eventually purged before the database can reclaim disk space.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Query plan</h3>

<p>A query plan is a sequence of step-like paths that the HP Vertica cost-based query optimizer selects to access or alter information in your HP Vertica database. You can get information about <a href="https://my.vertica.com/docs/7.0.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/AdministratorsGuide/EXPLAIN/HowToGetQueryPlanInformation.htm">query plans</a> by prefixing the SQL query with the <code>EXPLAIN</code> command.</p>

<pre><code class="sql EXPLAIN statement">EXPLAIN SELECT customer_name, customer_state FROM customer_dimension
WHERE customer_state in ('MA','NH') AND customer_gender = 'Male'     
ORDER BY customer_name LIMIT 10;
</code></pre>

<p>The output from a query plan is presented in a tree-like structure, where each step path represents a single operation in the database that the optimizer uses for its execution strategy. The following example output is based on the previous query:</p>

<pre><code class="bash Query Plan description">EXPLAIN SELECT
customer_name,
customer_state
FROM customer_dimension
WHERE customer_state in ('MA','NH')
AND customer_gender = 'Male'
ORDER BY customer_name
LIMIT 10;
Access Path:
+-SELECT  LIMIT 10 [Cost: 370, Rows: 10] (PATH ID: 0)
|  Output Only: 10 tuples
|  Execute on: Query Initiator
| +---&gt; SORT [Cost: 370, Rows: 544] (PATH ID: 1)
| |      Order: customer_dimension.customer_name ASC
| |      Output Only: 10 tuples
| |      Execute on: Query Initiator
| | +---&gt; STORAGE ACCESS for customer_dimension [Cost: 331, Rows: 544] (PATH ID: 2) 
| | |      Projection: public.customer_dimension_DBD_1_rep_vmartdb_design_vmartdb_design_node0001
| | |      Materialize: customer_dimension.customer_state, customer_dimension.customer_name
| | |      Filter: (customer_dimension.customer_gender = 'Male')
| | |      Filter: (customer_dimension.customer_state = ANY (ARRAY['MA', 'NH']))
| | |      Execute on: Query Initiator
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to understand the details of the query plan, observe the real-time flow of data through the plan to identify possible query bottlenecks, you can:</p>
