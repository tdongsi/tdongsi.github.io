<!--more-->


<p>I wish I knew Docker earlier, before going through the hassle of creating VMs for local ETL development and testing.
Docker can make the whole setup even easier.
It can be done in just a few commands, using <a href="https://github.com/tdongsi/vertica/tree/master/docker">a Vertica Dockerfile</a>, created based on <a href="https://github.com/wmarinho/docker-hp-vertica">this</a>.
In addition to easy virtualization, Docker also enables the entire setup can be automated in a script, allowing it to be version-controlled (i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code">Infrastructure as Code</a>).</p>

<p>Some notes about this Dockerfile, compared to <code>wmarinho</code>&rsquo;s:</p>

<ul>
<li>Added new schema, new user and new role as examples. Avoid using <code>dbadmin</code> user for development purpose.</li>
<li>Added Java and Maven for Java-based ETL and automated test execution.</li>
<li>Demonstrated running Bash and SQL scripts to initialize the container/database.</li>
</ul>


<h3>How to run</h3>

<p>Before running <code>docker build</code>, download Vertica Community Edition from <a href="https://my.vertica.com/">https://my.vertica.com/</a> and place in the same folder as the <code>Dockerfile</code>.
This <code>Dockerfile</code> takes &ldquo;vertica-7.2.3-0.x86_64.RHEL6.rpm&rdquo; as the install file.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting Notes</h3>

<p>In Mac OSX, remember that the <code>entrypoint.sh</code> file should have executable permission.
Otherwise, you might get the error &ldquo;oci runtime error: exec: &rdquo;/entrypoint.sh": permission denied".
After changing the file permission, you have to rebuild the image with <code>docker build</code> before <code>docker run</code> again.</p>

<h4>&ldquo;Insufficient resources&rdquo; error when running ETL</h4>

<p>You might get &ldquo;Insufficient resources to execute plan on pool general &hellip; Memory exceeded&rdquo; error when running a large ETL script against the Vertica container.
For complex ETL, Vertica might need additional memory to execute the query plan.
Simply setting higher memory allocation using <code>--memory</code> option of <code>docker run</code> might NOT work if using <strong>Docker Toolbox</strong>.
To set higher memory allowance, stop the <code>docker-machine</code> and set memory as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="plain">tdongsi$ docker-machine stop
Stopping "default"...
Machine "default" was stopped.

tdongsi$ VBoxManage modifyvm default --memory 8192

tdongsi$ docker-machine start
Starting "default"...
(default) Check network to re-create if needed...
(default) Waiting for an IP...
Machine "default" was started.
Waiting for SSH to be available...
Detecting the provisioner...
Started machines may have new IP addresses. You may need to re-run the `docker-machine env` command.
</code></pre>

<p>Note that after running the above commands, <code>docker-machine inspect</code> still shows <code>"Memory":"2048"</code>.
To verify if memory is properly allocated as desired, run <code>free</code> command, for example, inside the container to verify.</p>

    <link href="http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2016/08/17/analytic-functions-in-mysql/"/>
    <updated>2016-08-17T23:12:54-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2016/08/17/analytic-functions-in-mysql</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>MySQL has traditionally lagged behind in support for the SQL standard.
Unfortunately, from my experience, MySQL is often used as the sandbox for SQL code challenges and interviews.
If you are used to work with <a href="https://my.vertica.com/docs/7.1.x/HTML/index.htm#Authoring/SQLReferenceManual/SQLReferenceManual.htm">Vertica SQL</a>, writing SQL statements in MySQL can be challenging exercises, NOT necessarily in a good way, because many useful features are not supported.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>WITH clause</h3>

<p>As discussed in this <a href="/blog/2016/02/03/vertica-6-with-clause/">blog post</a>, <code>WITH</code> clause syntax, also known as <em>Common Table Expressions</em> (CTE), is thankfully supported in Vertica.
In summary, <code>WITH</code> clause allows us to arrange sub-queries, usually intermediate steps, in a complex SQL query in sequential, logical order.
This will make the complex queries easier to compose and read: we can write steps by steps of the query from top to bottom like a story (i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a>).
Unfortunately, <code>WITH</code> clause is not supported by MySQL although this feature has been requested since <a href="https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=16244">2006</a>.
There are <a href="http://guilhembichot.blogspot.fr/2013/11/with-recursive-and-mysql.html">work-arounds</a> for MySQL&rsquo;s lack of CTE, but the easiest way is probably to revert back to using nested subqueries.</p>

<p>Personally, lack of <code>WITH</code> clause support in MySQL is my greatest hindrance as I often ended up writing queries using <code>WITH</code> clauses as first draft before rewriting those queries using nested subqueries.
This might appear clumsy in SQL interviews even though writing SQL codes with CTE instead of subqueries is the recommended practice for maintainable code.</p>

<h3>Analytic functions</h3>

<p>Another regrettable hindrance when working in MySQL is its lack of analytic functions such as <code>ROW_NUMBER</code>, <code>RANK</code> and <code>DENSE_RANK</code>.
Those <a href="https://my.vertica.com/docs/7.1.x/HTML/index.htm#Authoring/SQLReferenceManual/Functions/Analytic/AnalyticFunctions.htm">analytic functions</a> are supported in Vertica.
The difference between these three functions can be a bit subtle, and would be best described in the following example:</p>

<pre><code class="sql Example of ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK functions">SELECT customer_name, SUM(annual_income),
ROW_NUMBER () OVER (ORDER BY TO_CHAR(SUM(annual_income),'100000') DESC) row_number, 
RANK () OVER (ORDER BY TO_CHAR(SUM(annual_income),'100000') DESC) rank, 
DENSE_RANK () OVER (ORDER BY TO_CHAR(SUM(annual_income),'100000') DESC) dense_rank 
FROM customer_dimension
GROUP BY customer_name
LIMIT 15;
</code></pre>

<p>The outputs of these functions are only different if there are duplicates in <code>SUM(annual_income)</code> value, as seen in rows 75-81 in the example output below:</p>

<table border="1"><tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF"><th>customer_name</th><th>SUM</th><th>row_number</th><th>rank</th><th>dense_rank</th></tr>
<tr><td>Theodore R. King</td><td>97444</td><td>71</td><td>71</td><td>71</td></tr>
<tr><td>Laura Y. Pavlov</td><td>97417</td><td>72</td><td>72</td><td>72</td></tr>
<tr><td>Carla . Garcia</td><td>97371</td><td>73</td><td>73</td><td>73</td></tr>
<tr><td>Jack Z. Miller</td><td>97356</td><td>74</td><td>74</td><td>74</td></tr>
<tr><td>Steve W. Williams</td><td>97343</td><td>75</td><td>75</td><td>75</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lauren Y. Rodriguez</td><td>97343</td><td>76</td><td>75</td><td>75</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lucas . Webber</td><td>97318</td><td>77</td><td>77</td><td>76</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sarah N. Moore</td><td>97243</td><td>78</td><td>78</td><td>77</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lucas O. Li</td><td>97184</td><td>79</td><td>79</td><td>78</td></tr>
<tr><td>Doug K. Reyes</td><td>97166</td><td>80</td><td>80</td><td>79</td></tr>
<tr><td>Michael . Weaver</td><td>97162</td><td>81</td><td>81</td><td>80</td></tr>
</table>


<p><br/></p>

<p>Sadly, these useful analytic functions are not supported in MySQL.
Fortunately, MySQL supports user variables in SQL queries and we can reproduce those functionalities in MySQL using variables and subqueries as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="sql ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK functions in MySQL">-- In Vertica
SELECT 
ROW_NUMBER () OVER (PARTITION BY col_1, col_2 ORDER BY col_3 DESC) AS row_number,
RANK () OVER (PARTITION BY col_1, col_2 ORDER BY col_3 DESC) AS rank,
DENSE_RANK () OVER (PARTITION BY col_1, col_2 ORDER BY col_3 DESC) AS dense_rank,
t.* 
FROM table_1 t

-- In MySQL
SELECT
@row_num:=IF(@prev_col_1=t.col_1 AND @prev_col_2=t.col_2, @row_num+1, 1) AS row_number,
@rank:=IF(@prev_col_1=t.col_1 AND @prev_col_2=t.col_2 AND @prev_col_3=col_3, @rank, @row_num) AS rank,
@dense:=IF(@prev_col_1=t.col_1 AND @prev_col_2=t.col_2, IF(@prev_col_3=col_3, @dense, @dense+1), 1) AS dense_rank,
@prev_col_1 = t.col_1,
@prev_col_2 = t.col_2,
@prev_col_3 = t.col_3,
t.*
FROM (SELECT * FROM table_1 ORDER BY col_1, col_2, col_3 DESC) t,
     (SELECT @row_num:=1, @dense:=1, @rank:=1, @prev_col_1:=NULL, @prev_col_2:=NULL, @prev_col_3:=NULL) var
</code></pre>

<p>The MySQL work-around is intentionally generic so that I can adapt it to any use case.
In addition, it intentionally has a single pass (no <code>SET</code> statements, temporary table) since most SQL code challenges expect a single query.
Finally, note that the above MySQL solution is intentionally incomplete to make it less convoluted.
You need to put that solution in a subquery and <code>SELECT</code> only relevant columns from it.</p>

<p>As an example, the above code template is used to solve <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-scores/">this Rank Scores problem</a>.
In summary, the question asks for <code>DENSE_RANK</code> functionality to be applied on Score column.</p>

<pre><code class="plain Input table">+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="plain Expected output">+-------+------+
| Score | Rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+
</code></pre>

<p>The solution in Vertica SQL would be straight-forward as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="sql Solution in Vertica SQL">select Score,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Score DESC) AS Rank
FROM Scores;
</code></pre>

<p>In MySQL, apply the above code template and note that there is no <code>partition clause</code> to arrive at the following solution:</p>

<pre><code class="sql Solution in MySQL">SELECT Score, Rank FROM
( SELECT t.Score,
@dense:=IF(@prev_col2=t.Score, @dense, @dense+1) AS Rank,
@prev_col2:=t.Score
FROM (SELECT Score FROM Scores ORDER BY Score DESC) t, 
(SELECT @dense:=0, @prev_col2:=NULL) var ) x
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the outer <code>SELECT</code> is used to only expose only columns of interest while the main SQL code is enclosed in a subquery.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Bash Trap]]></title>
    <link href="http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2016/03/02/bash-trap/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-02T00:07:48-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2016/03/02/bash-trap</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post, we discuss common usage of bash <code>trap</code> to ensure proper cleanup operations in Bash scripts.
It also discusses a common idiom <code>trap cleanup INT TERM EXIT</code> where other signals such as INT and TERM is also trapped in addition to EXIT.
While such idiom could be valid in some Unix system, it is usually redundant and can be simply wrong (duplicate executions) in most cases, as shown on Mac.
A simple test is provided to verify if such idiom is applicable in your current system.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Standard usage</h3>

<p>There is a simple idiom to ensure your bash scripts to always do proper cleanup operations before exiting, even when something goes wrong during execution.
In the context of Java or Python, this is similar to a <code>finally</code> clause that will execute after any exception is caught during execution.</p>

<pre><code class="bash DO THIS"># Setup trap to cleanup before exiting script
function cleanup {
    echo "Removing temp files..."
    if [[ -f $CMD_TMPFILE ]] ; then
        rm $CMD_TMPFILE
    fi
    if [[ -f $LOG_TMPFILE ]] ; then
        rm $LOG_TMPFILE
    fi
}
trap cleanup EXIT

# Setup

# Thousand lines of code here
</code></pre>

<p>Putting the cleanup operations at the end of the bash script might not work in cases of error.
Since the bash script already stops executing due to some fatal error, those clean up commands might never run.</p>

<pre><code class="bash DON'T DO THIS">
# Setup

# Thousand lines of code here

# This might not run when there is error
echo "Removing temp files..."
if [[ -f $CMD_TMPFILE ]] ; then
    rm $CMD_TMPFILE
fi
if [[ -f $LOG_TMPFILE ]] ; then
    rm $LOG_TMPFILE
fi
</code></pre>

<p>For example, in Vertica, you should always run <a href="https://my.vertica.com/docs/7.1.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/SQLReferenceManual/Functions/VerticaFunctions/START_REFRESH.htm"><code>SELECT START_REFRESH()</code></a>
at the end of a deployment script, regardless of any error encountered during script execution.
It is a good candidate for using <code>trap</code> statement.
Adding those commands at the end of the script will not work in cases there is an error during deployment, and you might end up with &ldquo;AHM Does Not Advance&rdquo;-related errors (see this <a href="/blog/2016/02/29/vertica-9-refresh-projections/">post</a>).</p>

<h3>Trap multiple signals</h3>

<p>Note that many online examples for <code>trap</code> use a list of signals for cleanup tasks like this <code>trap cleanup INT TERM EXIT</code>, i.e., trapping not only EXIT signal but also INT and TERM signals.
I believe that if <code>EXIT</code> signal is used, other signals such as <code>INT</code> or <code>TERM</code> are redundant for cleanup purposes.
<code>EXIT</code> or 0 signal is invoked when the shell exits, an event that also happens when an <code>INT</code> or <code>TERM</code> signal is received.
It is easy to confirm that with the following short bash script:</p>

<pre><code class="plain Trap tests in Mac OSX">MTVL1288aeea2-82:code tdongsi$ cat test_trap.sh
#!/bin/bash
trap 'echo SIGNAL CAPTURED' EXIT
sleep 3

MTVL1288aeea2-82:code tdongsi$ ./test_trap.sh &amp; sleep 1; kill -INT %1
[1] 6613
SIGNAL CAPTURED
[1]+  Interrupt: 2            ./test_trap.sh

MTVL1288aeea2-82:code tdongsi$ ./test_trap.sh &amp; sleep 1; kill -TERM %1
[1] 6624
SIGNAL CAPTURED
[1]+  Terminated: 15          ./test_trap.sh
</code></pre>

<p>As shown above, a lone <code>EXIT</code> is enough to capture <code>INT</code> and <code>TERM</code> signals.
Having said that, I understand that my tests can only verify bash on Mac OSX.
There are probably different shell variants on different operating systems which do not always work that way.</p>

<p>The problem of those <code>trap</code> examples lies in when someone copies and uses the code directly from the web, without understanding how it works.
Listing multiple signals can make the <code>cleanup</code> steps executed twice, once for the signal such as <code>TERM</code> and once for <code>EXIT</code>, as shown in the modified experiment below.
Not all cleanup steps could be and should be executed twice.
For example, it is almost always true that removing some temporary file/folder should not be executed twice during a cleanup.</p>

<pre><code class="plain Problem of trapping multiple signals">MTVL1288aeea2-82:code tdongsi$ cat test_trap.sh
#!/bin/bash
trap 'echo SIGNAL CAPTURED' INT TERM EXIT
sleep 3

MTVL1288aeea2-82:code tdongsi$ ./test_trap.sh &amp; sleep 1; kill -INT %1
[1] 7258
SIGNAL CAPTURED
SIGNAL CAPTURED
[1]+  Exit 130                ./test_trap.sh

MTVL1288aeea2-82:code tdongsi$ ./test_trap.sh &amp; sleep 1; kill -TERM %1
[1] 7278
Terminated: 15
SIGNAL CAPTURED
SIGNAL CAPTURED
[1]+  Exit 143                ./test_trap.sh
</code></pre>

<p>In short, you should know how <code>trap</code> works on your production system before listing multiple signals as its parameters, especially when coupled with <code>EXIT</code> signal.</p>

<h3>Other usage notes</h3>

<p>The signal names might be specified with or without prefix <code>SIG</code> or even with numeric values for signal numbers, e.g., 2 for INT (see list below).</p>

<pre><code class="plain List of signals">MTVL1288aeea2-82:octopress tdongsi$ kill -l
 1) SIGHUP   2) SIGINT   3) SIGQUIT  4) SIGILL
 5) SIGTRAP  6) SIGABRT  7) SIGEMT   8) SIGFPE
 9) SIGKILL 10) SIGBUS  11) SIGSEGV 12) SIGSYS
13) SIGPIPE 14) SIGALRM 15) SIGTERM 16) SIGURG
17) SIGSTOP 18) SIGTSTP 19) SIGCONT 20) SIGCHLD
21) SIGTTIN 22) SIGTTOU 23) SIGIO   24) SIGXCPU
25) SIGXFSZ 26) SIGVTALRM   27) SIGPROF 28) SIGWINCH
29) SIGINFO 30) SIGUSR1 31) SIGUSR2

OR 

MTVL1288aeea2-82:octopress tdongsi$ man signal
</code></pre>

<p>If one of the signals specified in <code>trap</code> statement is <code>DEBUG</code>, the list of COMMANDS specified in <code>trap</code> statement will be executed after every simple command.
This is useful for debugging purpose.
The following example is taken from <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/chap_12.html">here</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="bash Tracing when a variable is used">declare -t VARIABLE=value
trap "echo VARIABLE is being used here." DEBUG

# rest of the script
</code></pre>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[WITH Clause in SQL]]></title>
    <link href="http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2016/02/03/vertica-6-with-clause/"/>
    <updated>2016-02-03T00:50:48-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2016/02/03/vertica-6-with-clause</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am pleasantly surprised that Vertica SQL supports <code>WITH</code> clause, as documented <a href="https://my.vertica.com/docs/7.1.x/HTML/index.htm#Authoring/AnalyzingData/Queries/WITHClausesInSELECT.htm">here</a>.
<code>WITH</code> syntax as a standard is only defined in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:1999">SQL-99</a>, also called <em>Common Table Expressions</em>.
Therefore, I do not usually expect <code>WITH</code> clause since it is a fairly recent feature in most SQL dialects.
For example: <code>WITH</code> clause support is only added into SQLite since Feb 2014.</p>

<p>In summary, the <code>WITH</code> clause allows us to arrange sub-queries in a SQL query in order of human logic.
This will make our query much easier to read: we can read from top to bottom like reading a story (i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a>).</p>

<!--more-->


<p>For example, we can look into the following <code>SELECT</code> query:</p>

<pre><code class="sql Hard to read">SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT *,
  row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY last_modify_date DESC) AS rank 
  FROM stg_customer
) sorted_by_modify_date where sorted_by_modify_date.rank =1
</code></pre>

<p>Before <code>WITH</code> clause, SQL scripts are usually hard to read due to nesting of sub-queries.
To understand a SQL statement, we have to find and understand the innermost sub-query first and start working from inside out.
In addition, as shown in the first example, name <code>sorted_by_modify_date</code> following the sub-query makes reading harder, even with meaningful names.
The longer the inner query gets, the more likely the name for that query is pushed out of sight despite the fact that it is important to see an intention revealing name before reading such inner query.</p>

<p>The above example can be made easier to read using <code>WITH</code> clause as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="sql Easy to read">WITH sorted_by_modify_date AS (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id 
                                  ORDER BY last_modify_date DESC) AS rank 
    FROM stg_customer
)
SELECT * FROM sorted_by_modify_date
WHERE sorted_by_modify_date.rank = 1;  
</code></pre>

<p>As the second example demonstrates, <code>WITH</code> clause solves two problems: 1) names come first, 2) sub-queries are un-nested.
The <code>WITH</code> clause puts the name above the code, like declaring a function with code in the sub-query.
We can pick a meaningful, intention revealing name for it and we can refer to that &ldquo;function&rdquo; in the following sub-queries in the same <code>WITH</code> clause.
Moreover, the most powerful impact of <code>WITH</code> clause is that sub-queries can be un-nested to follow the order and flow of developers' thoughts.
We can define multiple queries for multiple steps, and each of them can refer to the <em>previously</em> defined queries in the same <code>WITH</code> clause.</p>

<p>The following example demonstrates the power of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a> in SQL, enabled by <code>WITH</code> clause:</p>

<pre><code class="sql Traffic classification of a Music website">WITH Total_Traffic AS
(
    SELECT temp.* from temp as clickstream_data
    where .... -- filtering
)
, Rock_Music as
(
    select * from Total_Traffic
    WHERE lower(evar28) LIKE 'rock_mus%'
)
, Instrumental_Music as
(
    select * from Total
    WHERE evar28 LIKE '%[ins_mus]%'
)
, Defined_Traffic as
(
    select * from Rock_Music
    UNION
    select * from Instrumental_Music
)
select traffic_date_key
, count(distinct visitor_id) as unique_visitor
from Defined_Traffic 
group by traffic_date_key
</code></pre>

<p>The purpose of this query is to find the daily number of &ldquo;Defined&rdquo; unique visitors from clickstream data.
Finding daily total unique visitors from Clickstream data is easy and, by subtracting &ldquo;Defined&rdquo; numbers from &ldquo;Total&rdquo; numbers, we can find the &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo; traffic numbers that help determine marketing decisions.
Note that the total &ldquo;defined&rdquo; unique visitor count is NOT equal to sum of all unique visitor counts from each classification (e.g., &ldquo;Rock&rdquo; + &ldquo;Instrumental&rdquo;) since some visitors will listen to both Rock and Instrumental music on the website.</p>

<p>It would be hard, if not impossible, to write such query using only nested sub-queries and achieve the same readability.
The ease of reading is from a combination of top-down code structure and meaningful block names before code blocks, both are properties of <code>WITH</code> clause.</p>

<p>In the past, without <code>WITH</code> clause, we used to create <code>TEMPORARY TABLES</code> in Vertica to save the immediate steps.
Now, we have a native SQL solution in <code>WITH</code> clause and a more powerful technique to create sub-queries.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>Problem:</h4>

<p>I want to use Vertica JDBC driver in my Eclipse Maven project. I have the jar file from the vendor (i.e., downloaded from HP-Vertica support website) but, obviously, that file is not in Maven central repository. My Maven build will not work without that dependency.</p>

<p>This post will also apply if you are behind a firewall and/or do not have external access for some reason.</p>

<!--more-->


<h4>Solution:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Download the jar file (e.g., the Vertica JDBC jar file).</li>
<li>At the same directory as the jar file, run the following command to install the jar to the local Maven repository (running in a different directory seems not work).</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="bash General Maven command">$ mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=&lt;GROUP_ID&gt; -DartifactId=&lt;ARTIFACT_ID&gt; -Dversion=&lt;VERSION&gt; -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=&lt;LOCAL_PATH_FOR_JAR&gt; -DgeneratePom=true
</code></pre>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code class="bash Example Maven command for Vertica JDBC">$ mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.vertica -DartifactId=vertica-jdbc -Dversion=7.0.1 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=~/Downloads/vertica/vertica-jdbc-7.0.1.jar -DgeneratePom=true
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Now when you run your maven goals, it will not look for this particular jar file in any external repository such as Maven Central Repository since Maven checks and perceives that it is already in your local repository (your ~/.m2 directory).</li>
</ul>


<p>If you want your Eclipse to start using this jar from your local repository:</p>

<ul>
<li>In Eclipse Luna on a Mac/Windows, go to Window > Show View > Other > Maven > Maven Repository.</li>
<li>Open Local Repositories > Local Repository.</li>
<li>Right click for the context menu > Rebuild Index.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now it should show up in “Add…” dialog in pom.xml edit.</p>
