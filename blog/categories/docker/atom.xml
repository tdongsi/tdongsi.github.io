    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post, we looks into how to set up notification emails at the end of CI pipelines in a containerized Jenkins system.
First, we look into conventional Jenkins system (directly hosted) that has direct communication to the SMTP server.
After that, we will look into adjustments required for a containerized Jenkins system to run in the same environment.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Sending emails in standard Jenkins setup</h3>

<p>We first look at a typical Jenkins setup, where the Jenkins instance is installed directly on a host machine (VM or bare-metal) and has direct communication to the SMTP server.
For corporate network, you may have to use an SMTP relay server instead.
For those cases, you can configure SMTP communication by <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-postfix-as-a-send-only-smtp-server-on-ubuntu-14-04">setting up Postfix</a>.
Its typical settings is defined in <em>/etc/postfix/main.cf</em> file like this:</p>

<pre><code class="plain /etc/postfix/main.cf example"># See /usr/share/postfix/main.cf.bak for a commented, more complete version

myhostname = dev-worker-1.example.com
smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name
biff = no

# appending .domain is the MUA's job.
append_dot_mydomain = no

# Uncomment the next line to generate "delayed mail" warnings
#delay_warning_time = 4h

readme_directory = no

# TLS parameters
smtpd_tls_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
smtpd_tls_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
smtpd_use_tls=yes

# See /usr/share/doc/postfix/TLS_README.gz in the postfix-doc package for
# information on enabling SSL in the smtp client.


alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases
alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases
myorigin = dev-worker-1.example.com
mydestination = dev-worker-1.example.com, localhost.example.com, localhost
relayhost = smtprelay-prd.example.com
mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128
mailbox_size_limit = 0
recipient_delimiter = +
inet_interfaces = localhost
inet_protocols = all
</code></pre>

<p>We can test the setup by sending a test email with the following command:</p>

<pre><code class="plain Send a test email">[tdongsi@dev-worker-1 ~]# echo "Test localhost" | mailx -s Test tdongsi@example.com
send-mail: warning: inet_protocols: disabling IPv6 name/address support: Address family not supported by protocol
postdrop: warning: inet_protocols: disabling IPv6 name/address support: Address family not supported by protocol
</code></pre>

<p>After the <code>postfix</code> service is up, Jenkins can be configured to send email with <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Mailer">Mailer plugin</a>.
Mail server can be configured in <strong>Manage Jenkins</strong> page, <strong>E-mail Notification</strong> section.
Please visit <a href="http://www.nailedtothex.org/roller/kyle/entry/articles-jenkins-email">this post</a> for more detailed instructions and screenshots.
We can also test the configuration by sending test e-mail in the same <strong>E-mail Notification</strong> section.</p>

<h3>Sending email from container</h3>

<p>Many Jenkins-based CI systems have been containerized and deployed on Kubernetes cluster (in conjunction with <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin">Kubernetes plugin</a>).
For email notifications in such CI systems, one option is to reuse <code>postfix</code> service, which is usually configured and ready on the Kubernetes nodes, and expose it to the Docker containers.</p>

<p>There are two changes need to be made on Postfix to expose it to Docker containers on one host.</p>

<ol>
<li>Exposing Postfix to the docker network, that is, Postfix must be configured to bind to localhost as well as the docker network.</li>
<li>Accepting all incoming connections which come from any Docker containers.</li>
</ol>


<p>Docker bridge (<code>docker0</code>) acts a a bridge between your ethernet port and docker containers so that data can go back and forth.
We achieve the first requirement by adding the IP of <code>docker0</code> to <code>inet_iterfaces</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="plain ifconfig example output">[centos@dev-worker-1 ~]$ ifconfig
docker0: flags=4163&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1472
        inet 172.22.91.1  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 0.0.0.0
        ether 02:42:88:5f:24:28  txqueuelen 0  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 8624183  bytes 18891507332 (17.5 GiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 15891332  bytes 16911210191 (15.7 GiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

flannel0: flags=4305&lt;UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,NOARP,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1472
        inet 172.22.91.0  netmask 255.255.0.0  destination 172.22.91.0
        unspec 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  txqueuelen 500  (UNSPEC)
        RX packets 10508237  bytes 7051646109 (6.5 GiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 15511583  bytes 18744591891 (17.4 GiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
</code></pre>

<p>For the second requirement, the whole docker network as well as localhost should be added to <code>mynetworks</code>.
In our kubernetes setup, the docker network should be <code>flannel0</code> and its subnet&rsquo;s CIDR notation is added to the <code>mynetworks</code> line:</p>

<pre><code class="plain Modified "/etc/postfix/main.cf""># See /usr/share/postfix/main.cf.bak for a commented, more complete version

myhostname = dev-worker-1.example.com
smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name
biff = no

# appending .domain is the MUA's job.
append_dot_mydomain = no

# Uncomment the next line to generate "delayed mail" warnings
#delay_warning_time = 4h

readme_directory = no

# TLS parameters
smtpd_tls_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
smtpd_tls_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
smtpd_use_tls=yes

# See /usr/share/doc/postfix/TLS_README.gz in the postfix-doc package for
# information on enabling SSL in the smtp client.

alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases
alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases
myorigin = dev-worker-1.example.com
mydestination = dev-worker-1.example.com, localhost.example.com, localhost
relayhost = smtprelay-prd.example.com
mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128 172.22.0.0/16
mailbox_size_limit = 0
recipient_delimiter = +
inet_interfaces = localhost, 172.22.91.1
inet_protocols = all
</code></pre>

<p>Note the differences in <code>inet_interfaces</code> and <code>mynetworks</code> from the last section.
One can simply enter the Docker container/Kubernetes pod to verify such setup.
Note that application <code>mailx</code> maybe not available in a container since we tend to keep the containers light-weight.
Instead, prepare a <code>sendmail.txt</code> file (based on <a href="http://docs.blowb.org/setup-host/postfix.html">this</a>) with the following SMTP commands and use <code>nc</code> to send out the email as shown below.</p>

<pre><code class="plain Send test email from container">mymac:k8s tdongsi$ kubectl --kubeconfig kubeconfig --namespace jenkins exec -it jenkins-8hgsn -- bash -il

jenkins@jenkins-8hgsn:~/test$ cat sendmail.txt
HELO x
MAIL FROM: test@example.com
RCPT TO: tdongsi@example.com
DATA
From: test@example.com
To: $YOUR_EMAIL
Subject: This is a test

The test is successful

.
quit

jenkins@jenkins-8hgsn:~/test$ nc 172.22.91.1 25 &lt;sendmail.txt
220 dev-worker-1.eng.sfdc.net ESMTP Postfix
250 dev-worker-1.eng.sfdc.net
250 2.1.0 Ok
250 2.1.5 Ok
354 End data with &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;
250 2.0.0 Ok: queued as 1EF9E60C34
221 2.0.0 Bye
</code></pre>

<p>For containerized Jenkins system, mail server can also be configured in same <strong>Manage Jenkins</strong> page, <strong>E-mail Notification</strong> section.
The only difference is the IP/hostname provided to <strong>SMTP server</strong> option.
Instead of providing the known SMTP server&rsquo;s IP and host, one should use the IP of <code>docker0</code>, as explained above.
In the case of many nodes in Kubernetes cluster with different <code>docker0</code> IP, the Docker container of Jenkins master should reside only on one host and <code>docker0</code>&rsquo;s IP on that host should be used.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this blog post, we are using <a href="/blog/2017/04/23/docker-out-of-docker/">&ldquo;Docker out of Docker&rdquo; approach</a> to build Docker images in our containerized Jenkins slaves.
We look into a problem usually encountered in that approach, especially when reusing a Docker image for another Kubernetes cluster.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Problem description</h3>

<p>We got the following error when running Docker inside a Jenkins slave container.</p>

<pre><code class="plain Error message when running Docker">+ docker images
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this host?
</code></pre>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p>In summary, for <a href="/blog/2017/04/23/docker-out-of-docker/">&ldquo;Docker out of Docker&rdquo; approach</a>, the basic requirements to enable building Docker images in a containerized Jenkins slave is:</p>

<ol>
<li>You&rsquo;ll need to mount &ldquo;/var/run/docker.sock&rdquo; as a volume at &ldquo;/var/run/docker.sock&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Having <code>docker</code> CLI installed in the containerized Jenkins slave.</li>
<li>Make sure &ldquo;/var/run/docker.sock&rdquo; has the right permission inside the Jenkins slave container: readable for the current user (e.g., user <code>jenkins</code>) or in &ldquo;docker&rdquo; group.</li>
</ol>


<p>The direct cause of the above error message &ldquo;Cannot connect to the Docker daemon&rdquo; is that the socket &ldquo;/var/run/docker.sock&rdquo; to <code>docker</code> daemon on that Jenkins slave does not have the right permission for the current user (<code>jenkins</code> in the example).
By convention, the read permission to that Unix domain socket &ldquo;/var/run/docker.sock&rdquo; is given to <code>root</code> user or users in <code>docker</code> group.
The following commands verify that it is not:</p>

<pre><code class="plain Show GID of docker group">+ ls -l /var/run/docker.sock

srw-rw----. 1 root 992 0 Mar 14 00:57 /var/run/docker.sock
+ cat /etc/group
...
docker:x:999:jenkins
</code></pre>

<p>The expected output of the above <code>ls</code> command is as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="plain Expected output">+ ls -l /var/run/docker.sock
srw-rw----. 1 root docker 0 Mar 14 00:57 /var/run/docker.sock
</code></pre>

<h3>Resolving problem</h3>

<p>To resolve the problem, simply entering the Docker image, update its <code>/etc/group</code> file with the correct GID for <code>docker</code> group.
In the example above, the line &ldquo;docker:x:999:jenkins&rdquo; should be updated to &ldquo;docker:x:992:jenkins&rdquo; to make it work.
It&rsquo;s recommended to run <code>docker commit</code> to save the modified container as a new Docker image and push it to Docker registry (similar process in <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/01/25/docker-root-user-in-a-pod/">this post</a>).</p>

<p>The root cause of the problem is that the Docker image of Jenkins slave is built inside another Kubernetes cluster (see example Dockerfile below).
The group <code>docker</code> happens to have the group ID 999 on that Kubernetes cluster.</p>

<pre><code class="plain Dockerfile for installing Docker CLI in Jenkins slave http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31466812/access-docker-sock-from-inside-a-container">FROM jenkins

USER root
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
ENV HOME /home/jenkins
ENV DOCKER_VERSION=1.9.1-0~trusty

RUN apt-get update \
  &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y docker-engine=$DOCKER_VERSION \
  &amp;&amp; rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN usermod -a -G docker jenkins
</code></pre>

<p>For illustration, the Docker installation steps in Ubuntu are similar:</p>

<pre><code class="plain Installing Docker CLI https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/linux-postinstall/"># Install from Web
sudo curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins

# Install from apt
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker-engine
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
</code></pre>

<p>The last step <code>usermod</code> comes from Docker documentation itself: &ldquo;If you would like to use Docker as a non-root user, you should now consider adding your user to the "docker&rdquo; group".</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post, we look into two different approaches to solving the problem of building/pushing Docker images from a containerized Jenkins system.
From that understanding, we will discuss the pros and cons of each approach in production Continuous Integration (CI) systems and how one should be used in practice.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Docker-in-Docker &amp; Docker-out-of-Docker</h3>

<p>Jenkins as a CI system has been increasingly containerized and ran as a Docker container in production.
An example setup is to run Jenkins on top of a Kubernetes cluster with Jenkins slaves are created on demand as containers, using <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin">Kubernetes plugin</a>.
The problem in this post arises from how to build/run/push the Docker images insides a Jenkins system that run as a Docker container itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Docker-in-Docker&rdquo; refers to the approach of installing and running another Docker engine (daemon) inside Docker containers.
Since Docker 0.6, a &ldquo;privileged&rdquo; option is added to allow running containers in a special mode with almost all capabilities of the host machine, including kernel features and devices acccess.
As a consequence, Docker engine, as a privileged application, can run inside a Docker container itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Docker-in-Docker&rdquo; is first discussed by Jerome Petazzoni in <a href="https://blog.docker.com/2013/09/docker-can-now-run-within-docker/">this blog post</a> with example codes.
However, in <a href="https://jpetazzo.github.io/2015/09/03/do-not-use-docker-in-docker-for-ci/">another following blog post</a>, Jerome cautioned against using his &ldquo;dind&rdquo; approach in containerized Jenkins.
He pointed out potential problems with his &ldquo;Docker-in-Docker&rdquo; approach and how to avoid those by simply bind-mounting the Docker socket into the Jenkins container.
The approach of bind-mounting the Docker socket is later referred as &ldquo;Docker-out-of-Docker&rdquo; approach.</p>

<h3>Which one should we use?</h3>

<p>As spelled out clearly by &ldquo;Docker-in-Docker&rdquo; creator Jerome Petazzoni himself, we should not use Docker-in-Docker, especially in containerized Jenkins systems.
Potential problems include 1) security profile of inner Docker will conflict with one of outer Docker 2) Incompatible file systems (e.g. AUFS inside Docker container).</p>

<p>Instead of trying to run Docker engine inside containers, it is advised to just expose the Docker socket to those containers.
This can be done by bind-mounting with the <code>-v</code> flag:</p>

<pre><code class="plain Docker out of Docker">docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ...
</code></pre>

<p>By using the above command, we can access the Docker daemon (running on the host machine) from inside the Docker container, and able to start/build/push containers.
The containers that are started inside the Docker container above are effectively &ldquo;sibling&rdquo; containers instead of &ldquo;child&rdquo; containers since the outer and inner containers are all running on the same host machine.
However, it is important to note that this feels like &ldquo;Docker-in-Docker&rdquo; but without any tricky problems associated with this.
And for the purpose of building/running/pushing Docker images in containerized Jenkins systems, this &ldquo;Docker-out-of-Docker&rdquo; is exactly all we need.</p>

<h3>Further discussion</h3>

<p>The potential issues of &ldquo;Docker-in-Docker&rdquo; is extensively discussed by Jerome Petazzoni in his blog post.
However, what&rsquo;s not mentioned is any potential problem of &ldquo;Docker-out-of-Docker&rdquo; approach.</p>

<p>In my opinion, one potential issue of &ldquo;Docker-out-of-Docker&rdquo; approach is one can access the outer Docker container from the inner container through &ldquo;/var/run/docker.sock&rdquo;.
In the context of containerized Jenkins system, the outer Docker container is usually Jenkins master with sensitive information.
The inside Docker containers are usually Jenkins slaves that are subject to running all kinds of code which might be malicious.
This means that a containerized Jenkins system can be easily compromised if there is no limit on what&rsquo;s running in Jenkins slaves.</p>

<p>It should be noted that, despite of problems listed by Jerome, &ldquo;Docker-in-Docker&rdquo; approach is still a possible choice *IF* you know what you are doing.
Conflict of security profiles can be resolved with the right, careful setup.
There are work-arounds for incompatible file systems between the containers.
With the right setup, &ldquo;Docker-in-Docker&rdquo; can provide essentially free build isolation and security, which is a must for many, especially in corporates.
However, the ever-present disadvantage of this apporach is long build time for large Docker images since Docker image cache has to be re-populated every run.
As noted by Jerome, this cache is designed for exclusive access by one single Docker daemon at once.
Trying to link this cache in each container to some common, pre-populated Docker image cache will lead to corrupt image data.</p>

    <link href="http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2017/02/09/docker-copy-file-into-a-container/"/>
    <updated>2017-02-09T15:17:19-08:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this blog post, we have a running Docker container or a running pod in Kubernetes cluster.
We want to add some files into the running containers to fix some issue, verify, and commit the changes.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Best-case scenario: <code>docker cp</code></h3>

<p>The most obvious way is to create a Dockerfile and rebuild the Docker image.
The Dockerfile will look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="plain Dockerfile">FROM olderImage
ADD myfile /path/myfile
...
</code></pre>

<p>However, in this approach, we need to stop the Docker containers, update, and re-run with the new Docker images.
It does not work if we want to work with <strong><em>running</em></strong> containers.
For running containers, the better way to add files into containers is to copy files into containers.
For the more updated versions of Docker (1.8+), the recommended way for copying is to use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/"><code>docker cp</code> command</a>.</p>

<h3>Copy file directly</h3>

<p><code>docker cp</code> does not always work, especially in older versions of Docker.
In older versions of Docker, the <code>docker cp</code> command only allowed copying files from a <strong>container</strong> to the <strong>host</strong>.
Only since Docker 1.8, copying files from the host to a container is added.
You will get some error with unhelpful messages like this in older versions of Docker:</p>

<pre><code class="plain Unsupported "docker cp"">[centos@comp ~]$ ls maven_3.3.9-3_all.deb
maven_3.3.9-3_all.deb

[centos@comp ~]$ sudo docker cp maven_3.3.9-3_all.deb 9a8d782156ca:/home/jenkins
FATA[0000] Error: Path not specified
[centos@comp ~]$ sudo docker cp ./maven_3.3.9-3_all.deb 9a8d782156ca:/home/jenkins
FATA[0000] Error: Path not specified
[centos@comp ~]$ sudo docker cp ./maven_3.3.9-3_all.deb 9a8d782156ca:/home/jenkins/
FATA[0000] Error: Path not specified
[centos@comp ~]$ sudo docker cp maven_3.3.9-3_all.deb 9a8d782156ca:/home/jenkins/maven_3.3.9-3_all.deb
FATA[0000] Error: Path not specified
</code></pre>

<p>If you find yourself stuck with older versions of Docker, the alternative is to manually copy the files from hosts filesystem to containers filesystem location.
First, you need to determine where the containers filesystem (volume) is mounted on the host:</p>

<pre><code class="plain Using inspect to find Volume location">[centos@comp ~]$ sudo docker ps
CONTAINER ID      IMAGE    COMMAND ...
9a8d782156ca

[centos@comp ~]$ sudo docker inspect -f { {.Id} } 9a8d782156ca
9a8d782156ca9a3bd59545a18943de408ca58f42c4389c12e9bb43f4ad239d52

[centos@comp ~]$ sudo docker inspect -f { {.Volumes} } 9a8d782156ca
map[/home/jenkins:/var/lib/docker/vfs/dir/b051cc2b086c53ce436ad82b9332ba79687f3ddcf8ee77e3f8264e7cafe32438]
[centos@comp ~]$ sudo ls /var/lib/docker/vfs/dir/b051cc2b086c53ce436ad82b9332ba79687f3ddcf8ee77e3f8264e7cafe32438
test.txt
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: In the shell commands above, there is no space between <code>{</code> (space is added for Jekyll blog engine).
After the mounting path is determined, you can manipulate the container'ss filesystem directly, including copying files into it.</p>

<pre><code class="plain Directly copy file into containers filesystem">[centos@comp ~]$ sudo cp maven_3.3.9-3_all.deb /var/lib/docker/vfs/dir/b051cc2b086c53ce436ad82b9332ba79687f3ddcf8ee77e3f8264e7cafe32438
</code></pre>

<p>You can verify such manipulation by <code>docker exec</code>-ing into the container and verify the files:</p>

<pre><code class="plain Before and After">jenkins@9a8d782156ca:~$ ls
test.txt

jenkins@9a8d782156ca:~$ ls
maven_3.3.9-3_all.deb  test.txt
</code></pre>

<h3>Problem description</h3>

<p>The docker image for JNLP-based Jenkins agent requires us to pass a few arguments.
Simply running such docker image will give the following error:</p>

<pre><code>mymac:jenkins tdongsi$ docker run --restart=always gcr.io/jenkins-agent:2.60
two arguments required, but got []
java -jar slave.jar [options...] &lt;secret key&gt; &lt;slave name&gt;
 -cert VAL                       : Specify additional X.509 encoded PEM
                                   certificates to trust when connecting to
                                   Jenkins root URLs. If starting with @ then
                                   the remainder is assumed to be the name of
                                   the certificate file to read.
 -credentials USER:PASSWORD      : HTTP BASIC AUTH header to pass in for making
                                   HTTP requests.
 -headless                       : Run in headless mode, without GUI
 -jar-cache DIR                  : Cache directory that stores jar files sent
                                   from the master
 -noreconnect                    : If the connection ends, don't retry and just
                                   exit.
 -proxyCredentials USER:PASSWORD : HTTP BASIC AUTH header to pass in for making
                                   HTTP authenticated proxy requests.
 -tunnel HOST:PORT               : Connect to the specified host and port,
                                   instead of connecting directly to Jenkins.
                                   Useful when connection to Hudson needs to be
                                   tunneled. Can be also HOST: or :PORT, in
                                   which case the missing portion will be
                                   auto-configured like the default behavior
 -url URL                        : Specify the Jenkins root URLs to connect to.
</code></pre>

<p>Most of the error messages above is from Jenkins binary <code>slave.jar</code> and has nothing to do with Docker.
To make the container run on Docker, we must override its <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> at runtime to provide the arguments required.
However, one common mistake while trying to override is as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="plain Standard mistake">mymac:jenkins tdongsi$ docker run --restart=always gcr.io/jenkins-agent:2.60 \
--entrypoint java -jar /usr/share/jenkins/slave.jar
"--entrypoint" is not a valid option
</code></pre>

<p>Except for passing argument to the <code>ENTRYPOINT</code>, the Docker image is usually the last parameter.
Another attempt to make it &ldquo;right&rdquo; is as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="plain Another attempt, still not working">mymac:jenkins tdongsi$ docker run --restart=always \
--entrypoint="java -jar /usr/share/jenkins/slave.jar" gcr.io/jenkins-agent:2.60

container_linux.go:247: starting container process caused "exec: \"java -jar /usr/share/jenkins/slave.jar\": 
stat java -jar /usr/share/jenkins/slave.jar: no such file or directory"
docker: Error response from daemon: oci runtime error: container_linux.go:247: starting container process 
caused "exec: \"java -jar /usr/share/jenkins/slave.jar\": stat java -jar /usr/share/jenkins/slave.jar: no such
 file or directory".
ERRO[0001] error getting events from daemon: net/http: request canceled
</code></pre>

<p>This attempt try to put the entire overridden command as the parameter for &ldquo;&ndash;entrypoint&rdquo; flag.
However, this does NOT work because, as stated in documentation, the entrypoint should specify the <strong>executable</strong>, not the command.
The correct way to do it is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>mymac:jenkins tdongsi$ docker run --restart=always --entrypoint="java" \
gcr.io/jenkins-agent:2.60 -jar /usr/share/jenkins/slave.jar \
-jnlpUrl http://10.252.78.115/computer/slave/slave-agent.jnlp

Failing to obtain http://10.252.78.115/computer/slave/slave-agent.jnlp
java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused
    at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.socketConnect(Native Method)
</code></pre>

<p>As seeen above, the executable is passed into &ldquo;&ndash;entrypoint&rdquo; flag, while its arguments are being passed <strong>after</strong> the image name.</p>
