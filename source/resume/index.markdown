  Work with developers on product features to make informed testing decisions, develop appropriate test solutions.
* Reviewed Java codes and enforced good practices for more robust and flexible Java API.
* Selected Projects and Achievements:
    * Designed and implemented test plans for measuring **data ingestion performance** of graph database
      InfiniteGraph in **distributed multi-client settings**. 
      Set up and configured a network of eight Linux and Windows hosts with OpenSSH. 
      Fully automated performance tests using Python scripts, in which multiple Java test applications are compiled and ingest data simultaneously from multiple remote hosts.
    * Designed and developed an automated test suite for testing Java byte code injection tools, including a custom Java parser (based on ANLTR) to verify correctness of decompiled byte codes after injection.
    * Developed functional tests for Talend data connectors for ETL pipelines from MySQL and Cassandra databases into Objectivity databases.
