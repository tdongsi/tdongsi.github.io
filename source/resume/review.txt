Accomplishments:

ArgoCD: setting up ArgoCD instances (beta/prod). Fully integrated with other systems in Apple: ProdGit OAuth for authentication/authorization, Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring. Advised the team on ArgoCDâ€™s best practices, integration with CI/CD pipelines for GitOps implementation. Upgraded and scaled up ArgoCD prod to host applications for Solr infra monitoring as well as DEVEL/TEST services for ACI Kube migration.

Orca-Jenkins: working with Data Engineering team and DataOps for general migraiton of Orca-Jenkins to ACI Kube: migration of Jenkins configurations to ACI Kube-based ConfigMaps, migration of classic jobs to Pipeline-based jobs for resiliency against container restarts, advising on ArgoCD/Kustomize usage for updates/deployments.

CI/CD: First implementations of nightly deployment and on-demand deployment for ACI Kube: Docker images for Jenkins agent to execute Gradle/ArgoCD commands, basic automation scripts, Jenkins shared library for orchestration. On-going project.

ACI Kube migration:
url-bucketing-service: Swift-based service into ACI-Kube. Implemented automated deployment Jenkins jobs (Kustomize-based, not PCL-based) for Weian.
anf-toolbox migration with PCL: Porting anf-toolbox repo to ACI Kube using PCL: 3 services, convert Gneiss team's/Independent Release idiosyncrasies in Slug build/PIE deployment into corresponding Gradle jib/PCL-based configs.
Work with News-SRE for background services and other implementations: Access control policies, event-watchers for logging events into Splunk, pod-reaper for automatic cleanup.
