[Pt 1](/blog/2016/03/20/sql-unit-functional-tests/).

In this blog post, I shows some example test cases using the SQL Test Runner, introduced in "Level 3" in [this post](/blog/2016/03/20/sql-unit-functional-tests/).
As mentioned in that post and will be illustrated here, many decisions are based on my testing philosophy: **prioritize readability of tests when possible**.
