From my experience, MySQL is regularly used as the sandbox for SQL code challenges and interviews.
However, MySQL has traditionally lagged behind in support for the SQL standard.
For example, WITH clause.

Having working with [Vertica SQL](https://my.vertica.com/docs/7.1.x/HTML/index.htm#Authoring/SQLReferenceManual/SQLReferenceManual.htm), trying to write SQL statements in MySQL is a tough experience.
Write code with WITH statements, then rewrite it with subqueries.

Analytical functions: row_number, rank, dense_rank.
