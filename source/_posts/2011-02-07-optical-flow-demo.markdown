This is my only presence on Youtube.
The demo is done for a presentation in the course "EE 243: Advanced Computer Vision" at UCR.
It implements Lucas-Kanade method for optical flow tracking, using a very old version (1.0) of OpenCV.
OpenCV was pretty rudimentary back then when most are done by manipulating CvMat objects although basic algorithms such as K-mean clustering are available.
