In Qualification Round of Google Code Jam 2016, there is an interesting [problem](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/6254486/dashboard#s=p2).

The summarized problem statement is as follows:

{% blockquote %}
A jamcoin is a string of N â‰¥ 2 digits with the following properties:

1) Every digit is either 0 or 1.
2) The first digit is 1 and the last digit is 1.
3) If you interpret the string in any base between 2 and 10, inclusive, the resulting number is not prime.

Can you produce J different jamcoins of length N, along with proof that they are legitimate?

For example, for the jamcoin 1001, a possible set of nontrivial divisors for the base 2 through 10 interpretations of the jamcoin would be: 3, 7, 5, 6, 31, 8, 27, 5, and 77, respectively.
{% endblockquote %}

The name "jamcoin" is probably a play on Bitcoin, since it also deals with prime/compsite numbers, a topic commonly found in cryptography.
In this problem, we apparently need to determine lots of large numbers (32 digits for Large dataset) if they are composite numbers.

The very first idea, building a sieve of primes for up to 10^16, seems not feasible for this problem since it will take lots of time and space (e.g., $\mathcal{O}(n\log{}n \log{}\log{}n)$ and $\mathcal{O}(n)$ for [sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes), respectively).

Note that we don't need to find all but only J of those jamcoins.
Therefore, we can keep iterating over all possible "jam coins" to find the first J numbers that satisfy the conditions.
To quickly determine if a large number is a composite/prime number, we can use Rabin-Miller primality test.
For reference, the Rabin-Miller primality test algorithm is based on the following [theorem](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Rabin-MillerStrongPseudoprimeTest.html): 

* If p is a prime, let s be such that $p-1 = 2^{s}d$ and $d$ is odd. Then for any $1 \leq n \leq p-1$, one of two things happens:

<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
&amp; n^d = 1 \mod p \mbox{, or} \\
&amp; n^{2^j d} = -1 \mod p \mbox{ for some } 0 \leq j &lt; s.
\end{align}\]</span></p>

In Rabin-Miller test, we pick $k$ random samples of $n$ in the range $1 \leq n \leq p-1$.
If p is not a prime, then it is at least a 3/4 chance that a randomly chosen $n$ will be a fail.
For large $k$ independent tests, the probability that it passes all test is (1/4)^k ~ 0.

The test is very fast, with runtime complexity of $k \log{}^3 n$ where k is the trial number.
Since we looks for composite numbers, this algorithm is even better-suited: even if a number passes all Rabin-Miller trials, we are still NOT sure if it is a prime.
However, if a number fails one of Rabin-Miller trial, we are sure that it is a composite number.

Implementation of this algorithm in different languages can be found on Internet, such as [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation/Mathematics/Primality_Testing).
I re-implemented this algorithm in Python (shown below) since 1) it is simple enough, and 2) I want to avoid disqualification from Google Code Jam for plagiarism. 
The function `rabin_miller_trial` is nested in `is_pseudo_prime` to keep its function signature simple and it is unlikely reused anywhere else.
