In Qualification Round of Google Code Jam 2016, there is this [problem](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/6254486/dashboard#s=p2).

The summarized problem statement is as follows:

{% blockquote %}
A jamcoin is a string of N â‰¥ 2 digits with the following properties:

1) Every digit is either 0 or 1.
2) The first digit is 1 and the last digit is 1.
3) If you interpret the string in any base between 2 and 10, inclusive, the resulting number is not prime.

Can you produce J different jamcoins of length N, along with proof that they are legitimate?

For example, for the jamcoin 1001, a possible set of nontrivial divisors for the base 2 through 10 interpretations of the jamcoin would be: 3, 7, 5, 6, 31, 8, 27, 5, and 77, respectively.
{% endblockquote %}

Theorem: if p is a prime, let s be the maximal power of 2 dividing p-1, so that p-1 = 2^{s}d and d is odd. Then for any 1 \leq n \leq p-1, one of two things happens:

n^d = 1 \mod p or
n^{2^j d} = -1 \mod p for some 0 \leq j < s.
