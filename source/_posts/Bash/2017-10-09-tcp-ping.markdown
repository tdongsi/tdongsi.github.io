This post explains a work-around for pinging hosts in network where ICMP requests are blocked.

<!--more-->

There are times that we can `ssh` to our servers but simply can't `ping` those servers.

``` plain ssh works but ping fails
tdongsi$ ping 10.252.158.71
PING 10.252.158.71 (10.252.158.71): 56 data bytes
Request timeout for icmp_seq 0
Request timeout for icmp_seq 1
Request timeout for icmp_seq 2
Request timeout for icmp_seq 3
^C
--- 10.252.158.71 ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100.0% packet loss

tdongsi$ ssh centos@10.252.158.71
Last login: Mon Feb  6 23:35:41 2017 from 10.3.55.249
[centos@kube-1 ~]$ exit
logout
Connection to 10.252.158.71 closed.
```

One possible explanation of seemingly perplexing situation like above is that [ICMP requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol) (i.e., ping) are blocked.
It is not unheard of that an ISP or a network administrator blocks ICMP requests.
To work around that limitation, you can use a "TCP ping" on a port, using a tool like `nmap`.
The following examples check if a host can be reached via port 80:

``` plain "TCP ping" with nmap: success and failure.
tdongsi$ nmap -sn -PS80 10.252.158.71

Starting Nmap 7.40 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-03-03 17:17 PST
Nmap scan report for master-1 (10.252.158.71)
Host is up (0.051s latency).
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.06 seconds

tdongsi$ nmap -sn -PS80 master-2

Starting Nmap 7.40 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-10-09 14:35 PDT
Note: Host seems down. If it is really up, but blocking our ping probes, try -Pn
Nmap done: 1 IP address (0 hosts up) scanned in 2.02 seconds
```
