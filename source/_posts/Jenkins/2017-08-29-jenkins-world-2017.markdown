Some interesting talks in [Jenkins World 2017](https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/schedule) are summarized in this blog post.

### Managing Jenkins with CloudBees Jenkins Team

CloudBees Jenkins is the Enterprise version of Jenkins, as opposed to Open-Source Jenkins.
This enterprise version offers the following features:

* Beekeeper Upgrade Assistant: Plugin upgrade compatibility, Compliance report.
* Upgrade simulations to make sure the upgrade is compatible with current jobs/plugins.

Like many other tools presented in the conference, you can do many "awesome" things **IF** you pay for it.
The only problem is if you have the budget to pay for it.

### Let's build a Jenkins Pipeline

Basic tutorial on Jenkinsfile with Declarative syntax.
Not that interesting if you are already familiar with Jenkinsfile.

* [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/5d85kTqLfjOgdC)
* [Code snippets](https://gist.github.com/ericlong/25fd60f197f6c4c7b8f265af7a351e75)

### Developing Pipeline Libraries Locally

If you have ever tried developing Pipeline Libraries, you may have noticed how long it takes to deploy a new version to server to discover just another syntax error. Oleg will show how to edit and test Pipeline libraries locally before committing to the repository (with Configuration-as-Code and Docker).

* [DockerHub repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/onenashev/demo-jenkins-config-as-code/)
* [Github repo](https://github.com/oleg-nenashev/demo-jenkins-config-as-code)
