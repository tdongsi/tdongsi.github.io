Twitter users generally like the clear, digestable format on Apple News. 
Others also start appreciating human-curated contents on Apple News, especially in the context of "fake news" and deeply divided 2020 election.
It is [reported](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2020/12/06/what-does-bidens-news-diet-reveal-about-him.cnn/video/playlists/business-reliable-sources/) that the President-elect Joe Biden “relies on Apple News to help him get headlines from other reputable media sources.” 
[Politico](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2020/12/07/what-joe-biden-reads-and-watches-491081) also mentioned Biden’s media diet, noting he is a “devoted fan” of Apple News and has news app notifications on his iPhone on to keep up with stories throughout the day. 

P.S.: I'm just a little proud of my work's impact. This post is not meant to express my political views.
